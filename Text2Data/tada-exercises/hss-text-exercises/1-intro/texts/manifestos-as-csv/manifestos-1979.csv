Foreword
FOR ME, THE HEART OF POLITICS is not political theory, it is people and how they
want to live their lives.
No one who has lived in this country during the last five years can fail to be
aware of how the balance of our society has been increasingly tilted in favour
of the State at the expense of individual freedom.
This election may be the last chance we have to reverse that process, to restore
the balance of power in favour of the people. It is therefore the most crucial
election since the war.
Together with the threat to freedom there has been a feeling of helplessness,
that we are a once great nation that has somehow fallen behind and that it is
too late now to turn things round.
I don't accept that. 1 believe we not only can, we must. This manifesto points
the way.
It contains no magic formula or lavish promises. It is not a recipe for an easy
or a perfect life. But it sets out a broad framework for the recovery of our
country, based not on dogma, but On reason, on common sense, above all on the
liberty of the people under the law.
The things we have in common as a nation far outnumber those that set us apart.
It is in that spirit that I commend to you this manifesto.
Margaret Thatcher


I. Our five tasks
THIS ELECTION is about the future of Britain - a great country which seems to
have lost its way. It is a country rich in natural resources, in coal, oil, gas
and fertile farmlands. It is rich, too, in human resources, with professional
and managerial skills of the highest calibre, with great industries and firms
whose workers can be the equal of any in the world We are the inheritors of a
long tradition of parliamentary democracy and the rule of law.
Yet today, this country is faced with its most serious problems since the Second
World War. What has happened to our country, to the values we used to share, to
the success and prosperity we once took for granted?
During the industrial strife of last winter, confidence, self-respect, common
sense, and even our sense of common humanity were shaken. At times this society
seemed on the brink of disintegration.
Some of the reasons for our difficulties today are complex and go back many
years. Others are more simple and more recent. We do not lay all the blame on
the Labour Party: but Labour have been in power for most of the last fifteen
years and cannot escape the major responsibility.
They have made things worse in three ways. First, by practising the politics of
envy and by actively discouraging the creation of wealth, they have set one
group against another in an often bitter struggle to gain a larger share of a
weak economy.
Second, by enlarging the role of the State and diminishing the role of the
individual, they have crippled the enterprise and effort on which a prosperous
country with improving social services depends.
Third, by heaping privilege without responsibility on the trade unions, Labour
have given a minority of extremists the power to abuse individual liberties and
to thwart Britain's chances of success. One result is that the trade union
movement, which sprang from a deep and genuine fellow-feeling for the
brotherhood of man, is today more distrusted and feared than ever before.
It is not just that Labour have governed Britain badly. They have reached a
dead-end. The very nature of their Party now
prevents them from governing successfully in a free society and mixed economy.
Divided against themselves; devoid of any policies except those which have led
to and would worsen our present troubles; bound inescapably by ties of history,
political dogma and financial dependence to a single powerful interest group,
Labour have demonstrated yet again that they cannot speak and dare not act for
the nation as a whole.
Our country's relative decline is not inevitable. We in the Conservative Party
think we can reverse it, not because we think we have all the answers but
because we think we have the one answer that matters most. We want to work with
the grain of human nature, helping people to help themselves - and others. This
is the way to restore that self-reliance and self-confidence which are the basis
of personal responsibility and national success.
Attempting to do too much, politicians have failed to do those things which
should be done. This has damaged the country and the authority of government. We
must concentrate on what should be the priorities for any government. They are
set out in this manifesto.
Those who look in these pages for lavish promises or detailed commitments on
every subject will look in vain. We may be able to do more in the next five
years than we indicate here. We believe we can. But the Conservative
government's first job will be to rebuild our economy and reunite a divided and
disillusioned people.
Our five tasks are:
(i) To restore the health of our economic and social life, by controlling
inflation and striking a fair balance between the rights and duties of the trade
union movement.
(2) To restore incentives so that hard work pays, success is rewarded and
genuine new jobs are created in an expanding economy.
(3) To uphold Parliament and the rule of law.
(4) To support family life, by helping people to become home-owners, raising the
standards of their children's education, and concentrating welfare services on
the effective support of the old, the sick, the disabled and those who are in
real need.
(5) To strengthen Britain's defences and work with our allies to protect our
interests in an increasingly threatening world.
This is the strategy of the next Conservative government.
2. Restoring the balance
SOUND MONEY and a fair balance between the rights and obligations of unions,
management and the community in which they work are essential to economic
recovery. They should provide the stable conditions in which pay bargaining can
take place as responsibly in Britain as it does in other countries.
THE CONTROL OF INFLATION
Under Labour prices have risen faster than at any peacetime period in the three
centuries in which records have been kept, and inflation is now accelerating
again. The pound today is worth less than half its '974 value. On present form
it would be halved in value yet again within eight years. Inflation on this
scale has come near to destroying our political and social stability.
To master inflation, proper monetary discipline is essential, with publicly
stated targets for the rate of growth of the money supply. At the same time, a
gradual reduction in the size of the Government's borrowing requirement is also
vital. This Government's price controls have done nothing to prevent inflation,
as is proved by the doubling of prices since they came to power. All the
controls have achieved is a loss of jobs and a reduction in consumer choice.
The State takes too much of the nation's income; its share must be steadily
reduced. When it spends and borrows too much, taxes, interest rates, prices and
unemployment rise so that in the long run there is less wealth with which to
improve Our standard of living and our social services.
BETTER VALUE FOR MONEY
Any future government which sets out honestly to reduce inflation and taxation
will have to make substantial economies, and there should be no doubt about our
intention to do so. We do not pretend that every saving can be made without
change or complaint; but if the Government does not economise the sacrifices
required of ordinary people will be all the greater.
Important savings can be made in several ways. We will scrap expensive Socialist
programmes, such as the nationalisation of building land. We shall reduce
government intervention in industry and particularly that of the National
Enterprise Board, whose borrowing powers are planned to reach £4.5 billion. We
shall ensure that selective assistance to industry is not wasted, as it was in
the case of Labour's assistance to certain oil platform yards, on which over £20
million of public money was spent but no orders received.
The reduction of waste, bureaucracy and over-government will also yield
substantial savings. For example, we shall look for economies in the cost (about
£1.2 billion) of running our tax and social security systems. By comparison with
private industry, local direct labour schemes waste an estimated £400 million a
year. Other examples of waste abound, such as the plan to spend £50 million to
build another town hall in Southwark.
TRADE UNION REFORM
Free trade unions can only flourish in a free society. A strong and responsible
trade union movement could play a big part in our economic recovery. We cannot
go on, year after year, tearing ourselves apart in increasingly bitter and
calamitous industrial disputes. In bringing about economic recovery, we should
all be on the same side. Government and public, management and unions, employers
and employees, all have a common interest in raising productivity and profits,
thus increasing investment and employment, and improving real living standards
for everyone in a high-productivity, high-wage, low-tax economy. Yet at the
moment we have the reverse an economy in which the Government has to hold wages
down to try to make us competitive with other countries where higher real wages
are paid for by higher output.
The crippling industrial disruption which hit Britain last winter had several
causes: years with no growth in production; rigid pay control; high marginal
rates of taxation; and the extension of trade union power and privileges.
Between 1974 and 1976, Labour enacted a 'militants' charter' of trade union
legislation. It tilted the balance of power in bargaining throughout industry
away from responsible management and towards unions, and sometimes towards
unofficial groups of workers acting in defiance of their official union
leadership.
We propose three changes which must be made at once. Although the Government
refused our offer of support to carry them through the House of Commons last
January, our proposals command general assent inside and outside the trade union
movement.
I. PICKETING
Workers involved in a dispute have a right to try peacefully to persuade others
to support them by picketing, but we believe that right should be limited to
those in dispute picketing at their own place of work. In the last few years
some of the picketing we have witnessed has gone much too far. Violence,
intimidation and obstruction cannot be tolerated. We shall ensure that the
protection of the law is available to those not concerned in the dispute but who
at present can suffer severely from secondary action (picketing, blacking and
blockading). This means an immediate review of the existing law on immunities in
the light of recent decisions, followed by such amendment as may be appropriate
of the 1976 legislation in this field. We shall also make any further changes
that are necessary so that a citizen's right to work and go about his or her
lawful business free from intimidation or obstruction is guaranteed.
2. THE CLOSED SHOP
Labour's strengthening of the closed shop has made picketing a more
objectionable weapon. In some disputes, pickets have threatened other workers
with the withdrawal of their union cards if they refuse to co-operate. No union
card can mean no job. So the law must be changed. People arbitrarily excluded or
expelled from any union must be given the right of appeal to a court of law.
Existing employees and those with personal conviction must be adequately
protected, and if they lose their jobs as a result of a closed shop they must be
entitled to ample compensation.
In addition, all agreements for a closed shop must be drawn up in line with the
best practice followed at present and only if an overwhelming majority of the
workers involved vote for it by secret ballot. We shall therefore propose a
statutory code under Section 6 of the 1975 Employment Protection Act. We will
not permit a closed shop in the non-industrial civil service and will resist
further moves towards it in the newspaper industry. We are also committed to an
enquiry into the activities of the SLADE union, which have done so much to bring
trade unionism into disrepute.
3. WIDER PARTICIPATION
Too often trade unions are dominated by a handful of extremists who do not
reflect the common-sense views of most union members.
Wider use of secret ballots for decision-making throughout the trade union
movement should be given every encouragement. We will therefore provide public
funds for postal ballots for union elections and other important issues. Every
trade unionist should be free to record his decisions as every voter has done
for a hundred years in parliamentary elections, without others watching and
taking note.
We welcome closer involvement of workers, whether trade unionists or not, in the
decisions that affect them at their place of work. It would be wrong to impose
by law a system of participation in every company. It would be equally wrong to
use the pretext of encouraging genuine worker involvement in order simply to
increase union power or facilitate union control of pension funds.
TOO MANY STRIKES
Further changes may be needed to encourage people to behave responsibly and keep
the bargains they make at work. Many deficiencies of British industrial
relations are without foreign parallel. Strikes are too often a weapon of first
rather than last resort. One cause is the financial treatment of strikers and
their families. In reviewing the position, therefore, we shall ensure that
unions bear their fair share of the cost of supporting those of their members
who are on strike.
Labour claim that industrial relations in Britain cannot be improved by changing
the law. We disagree. If the law can be used to confer privileges, it can and
should also be used to establish obligations. We cannot allow a repetition of
the behaviour that we saw outside too many of our factories and hospitals last
winter.
RESPONSIBLE PAY BARGAINING
Labour's approach to industrial relations and their disastrous economic policies
have made realistic and responsible pay bargaining almost impossible. After
encouraging the 'social contract' chaos of 1974-5, they tried to impose
responsibility by the prolonged and rigid control of incomes. This policy
collapsed last winter as we warned that it would. The Labour government then
came full circle with the announcement of yet another 'social contract' with the
unions. For five years now, the road to ruin has been paved with such exchanges
of promises between the Labour government and the unions.
To restore responsible pay bargaining, we must all start by recognising that
Britain is a low-paid country because we have steadily become less efficient,
less productive, less reliable and less competitive. Under this Government, we
have more than doubled our pay but actually produced less in manufacturing
industry. It will do yet further harm to go on printing money to pay ourselves
more without first earning more. That would lead to even higher prices, fewer
jobs and falling living standards.
The return to responsibility will not be easy. It requires that people keep more
of what they earn; that effort and skill earn larger rewards; and that the State
leaves more resources for industry. There should also be more open and informed
discussion of the Government's economic objectives (as happens, for example, in
Germany and other countries) so that there is wider understanding of the
consequences of unrealistic bargaining and industrial action.
Pay bargaining in the private sector should be left to the companies and workers
concerned. At the end of the day, no one should or can protect them from the
results of the agreements they make.
Different considerations apply to some extent to the public sector, of whose
seven million workers the Government directly employs only a minority. In the
great public corporations, pay bargaining should be governed, as in private
ones, by what each can afford. There can be no question of subsidising excessive
pay deals.
Pay bargaining in central and local government, and other services such as
health and education, must take place within the limits of what the taxpayer and
ratepayer can afford. It is conducted under a variety of arrangements, some of
long standing, such as pay research. In consultation with the unions, we will
reconcile these with the cash limits used to control public spending, and seek
to conclude no-strike agreements in a few essential services. Bargaining must
also be put on a sounder economic footing, so that public sector wage
settlements take full account of supply and demand md diflerences between
regions, manning levels, job security and pension arrangements.
3. A more prosperous country
LABOUR HAVE GONE to great lengths to try to conceal the damage they have done to
the economy and to our prospects of economic expansion. Even in the depression
of the 19305 the British economy progressed more than it has under this Labour
government. Their favourite but totally false excuse is that their appalling
record is all due to the oil crisis and the world-wide economic depression. Yet
since the oil crisis, despite our coal, and gas and oil from the North Sea,
prices and unemployment in Britain have risen by more than in almost any other
major industrial country. And output has risen by less. With much poorer energy
supplies than Britain, the others have nonetheless done much better because they
have not had a Labour government or suffered from Labour's mistakes.
To become more prosperous, Britain must become more productive and the British
people must be given more incentive.
CUTTING INCOME TAX
We shall cut income tax at all levels to reward hard work, responsibility and
success; tackle the poverty trap; encourage saving and the wider ownership of
property; simplify taxes - like VAT; and reduce tax bureaucracy.
It is especially important to cut the absurdly high marginal rates of tax both
at the bottom and top of the income scale. It must pay a man or woman
significantly more to be in, rather than out of; work. Raising tax thresholds
will let the low-paid out of the tax net altogether, and unemployment and
short-term sickness benefit must be brought into the computation of annual
income.
The top rate of income tax should be cut to the European average and the higher
tax bands widened. To encourage saving we will reduce the burden of the
investment income surcharge. This will greatly help those pensioners who pay
this additional tax on the income from their life-time savings, and who suffer
so badly by comparison with members of occupational or inflation-proofed pension
schemes.
Growing North Sea oil revenues and reductions in Labour s public spending plans
Will not be enough to pay for the income tax cuts the country needs. We must
therefore be prepared to switch to some extent from taxes on earnings to taxes
on spending. Value Added Tax does not apply, and will not be extended, to
necessities like food, fuel, housing and transport. Moreover the levels of State
pensions and other benefits take price rises into account.
Labour's extravagance and incompetence have once again imposed a heavy burden on
ratepayers this year. But cutting income tax must take priority for the time
being over abolition of the domestic rating system.
A PROPERTY-OWNING DEMOCRACY
Unlike Labour, we want more people to have the security and satisfaction of
owning property Our proposals for encouraging home ownership are contained in
Chapter 5.
We reject Labour's plan for a Wealth Tax. We shall deal with the most damaging
features of the Capital Transfer and Capital Gains Taxes, and propose a simpler
and less oppressive system of capital taxation in the longer term. We will
expand and build on existing schemes for encouraging employee share-ownership
and our tax policies generally will provide incentive to save and build up
capital.
INDUSTRY, COMMERCE AND JOBS
Lower taxes on earnings and savings will encourage economic growth. But on their
own they will not be enough to secure it.
Profits are the foundation of a free enterprise economy. In Britain profits are
still dangerously low. Price controls can prevent them from reaching a level
adequate for the investment we need. In order to ensure effective competition
and fair pricing policies, we will review the working of the Monopolies
Commission, the Office of Fair Trading and the Price Commission, with the
legislation which governs their activities.
Too much emphasis has been placed on attempts to preserve existing jobs. We need
to concentrate more on the creation of conditions in which new, more modern,
more secure, better paid jobs come into existence. This is the best way of
helping the unemployed and those threatened with the loss of their jobs in the
future.
Government strategies and plans cannot produce revival, nor can subsidies. Where
it is in the national interest to help a firm in difficulties, such help must be
temporary and tapered.
We all hope that those firms which are at present being helped by the taxpayer
will soon be able to succeed by themselves; but success or failure lies in their
own hands.
Of course, government can help to ease industrial change in those regions
dependent on older, declining industries. We do not propose sudden, sharp
changes in the measures now in force. However, there is a strong case for
relating government assistance to projects more closely to the number of jobs
they create.
NATIONALISATION
The British people strongly oppose Labour's plans to nationalise yet more firms
and industries such as building, banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals and road
haulage. More nationalisation would further impoverish us and further undermine
our freedom. We will offer to sell back to private ownership the recently
nationalised aerospace and shipbuilding concerns, giving their employees the
opportunity to purchase shares.
We aim to sell shares in the National Freight Corporation to the general public
in order to achieve substantial private investment in it. We will also relax the
Traffic Commissioner licensing regulations to enable new bus and other services
to develop-particularly in rural areas-and we will encourage new private
operators.
Even where Labour have not nationalised they interfere too much. We shall
therefore amend the '975 Industry Act and restrict the powers of the National
Enterprise Board solely to the administration of the Government's temporary
shareholdings, to be sold off as circumstances permit. We want to see those
industries that remain nationalised running more successfully and we will
therefore interfere less with their management and set them a clearer financial
discipline in which to work.
High productivity is the key to the future of industries like British Rail,
where improvements would benefit both the work-force and passengers who have
faced unprecedented fare increases over the last five years.
FAIR TRADE
Just as we reject nationalisation, so we are opposed to the other Socialist
panacea-import controls. They would restrict consumer choice, raise prices and
invite damaging retaliation against British goods overseas. We will vigorously
oppose all kinds of dumping and other unfair foreign trade practices that
undermine jobs at home.
We fully support the renegotiated Multi-fibre Arrangement for textiles and will
insist that it is monitored effectively and speedily. We also believe in a
revised 'safeguard' clause under GATT, to give us a better defence against
sudden and massive surges of imports that destroy jobs.
SMALL BUSINESSES
The creation of new jobs depends to a great extent on the success of smaller
businesses. They have been especially hard hit under Labour. Our cuts in direct
and capital taxation, the simplification of VAT and our general economic and
industrial relations policies are the key to their future. We shall make
planning restraints less rigid; reduce the number of official forms and make
them simpler; provide safeguards against unfair competition from direct labour;
review the new 714 Certificate system for subcontractors and review with
representatives of the self-employed their National Insurance and pension
position. We shall amend laws such as the Employment Protection Act where they
damage smaller businesses-and larger ones too-and actually prevent the creation
of jobs.
We shall also undertake a thorough review of the enforcement procedures of
Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue, and introduce an easier regime for
small firms in respect of company law and the disclosure of their affairs.
ENERGY
The development of our energy resources provides a challenge for both our
nationalised industries and the private sector. Nowhere has private enterprise
been more successful in creating jobs and wealth for the nation than in bringing
North Sea oil and gas ashore. These benefits will be short-lived unless we
pursue a vigorous policy for energy saving. Labour's interference has
discouraged investment and could cost Britain billions of pounds in lost
revenue. We shall undertake a complete review of all the activities of the
British National Oil Corporation as soon as we take office. We shall ensure that
our oil tax and licensing policies encourage new production.
We believe that a competitive and efficient coal industry has an important role
in meeting energy demand, together with a proper contribution from nuclear
power. All energy developments raise important environmental issues, and we
shall ensure the fullest public participation in major new decisions.
AGRICULTURE
Our agricultural and food industries are as important and as efficient as any
that we have. They make an immense contribution to our balance of payments; they
provide jobs for millions of people and they sustain the economy of the
countryside. Labour have seriously undermined the profitability of these
industries, without protecting consumers against rising food prices which have
more than doubled during their term of office. We must ensure that these
industries have the means to keep abreast of those in other countries.
We believe that radical changes in the operation of the Common Agricultural
Policy (CAP) are necessary. We would, in particular, aim to devalue the Green
Pound within the normal lifetime of a Parliament to a point which would enable
our producers to compete on level terms with those in the rest of the Community.
We will insist on a freeze in CAP prices for products in structural surplus.
This should be maintained until the surpluses are eliminated. We could not
entertain discriminatory proposals such as those which the Commission recently
put forward for milk production.
The Uplands are an important part of our agriculture. Those who live and work
there should enjoy a reasonable standard of life.
FISHING
The Government's failure to negotiate with our Community partners proper
arrangements for fishing has left the industry in a state of uncertainty. The
general adoption of 200-mile limits has fundamentally altered the situation
which existed when the Treaty of Accession was negotiated. We would work for an
agreement which recognised: first, that United Kingdom waters contained more
fish than those of the rest of the Community countries put together; secondly,
the loss of fishing opportunities experienced by our fishermen; thirdly, the
rights of inshore fishermen; last, and perhaps most important of all, the need
for effective measures to conserve fish stocks which would be policed by
individual coastal states. In the absence of agreement, we would not hesitate to
take the necessary measures on our own, but of course on a non-discriminatory
basis.
ANIMAL WELFARE
The welfare of animals is an issue that concerns us all. There are problems in
certain areas and we will act immediately where it is necessary. More
specifically, we will give full support to the EEC proposals on the
transportation of animals. We shall update the Brambell Report, the codes of
welfare for farm animals, and the legislation on experiments on live animals. We
shall also re-examine the rules and enforcement applying to the export of live
animals and shall halt the export of cows and ewes recently calved and lambed.
4. The rule of law
THE MOST DISTURBING THREAT to our freedom and security is the growing disrespect
for the rule of law. In government as in opposition, Labour have undermined it.
Yet respect for the rule of law is the basis of a free and civilised life. We
will restore it, re-establishing the supremacy of Parliament and giving the
right priority to the fight against crime.
THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME
The number of crimes in England and Wales is nearly half as much again as it was
in 1973. The next Conservative government will spend more on fighting crime even
while we economise elsewhere.
Britain needs strong, efficient police forces with high morale. Improved pay and
conditions will help Chief Constables to recruit up to necessary establishment
levels. We will therefore implement in full the recommendations of the Edmund
Davies Committee. The police need more time to detect crime. So we will ease the
weight of traffic supervision duties and review cumbersome court procedures
which waste police time. We will also review the traffic laws, including the
totting-up procedure.
DETERRING THE CRIMINAL
Surer detection means surer deterrence. We also need better crime prevention
measures and more flexible, more effective sentencing. For violent criminals and
thugs really tough sentences are essential. But in other cases long prison terms
are not always the best deterrent. So we want to see a wider variety of
sentences available to the courts. We will therefore amend the 1961 Criminal
Justice Act which limits prison sentences on young adult offenders, and revise
the Children and Young Persons Act 1969 to give magistrates the power to make
residential and secure care orders on juveniles.
We need more compulsory attendance centres for hooligans at junior and senior
levels. In certain detention centres we will experiment with a tougher regime as
a short, sharp shock for young criminals. For certain types of offenders, we
also support the greater use of community service orders, intermediate treatment
and attendance centres. Unpaid fines and compensation orders are ineffective.
Fines should be assessed to punish the offender within his means and then be
backed by effective sanctions for non-payment.
Many people advocate capital punishment for murder. This must remain a matter of
conscience for Members of Parliament. But we will give the new House of Commons
an early opportunity for a free vote on this issue.
IMMIGRATION AND RACE RELATIONS
The rights of all British citizens legally settled here are equal before the law
whatever their race, colour or creed. And their opportunities ought to be equal
too. The ethnic minorities have already made a valuable contribution to the life
of our nation. But firm immigration control for the future is essential if we
are to achieve good community relations. It will end persistent fears about
levels of immigration and will remove from those settled, and in many cases born
here, the label of 'immigrant'.
(i) We shall introduce a new British Nationality Act to define entitlement to
British citizenship and to the right of abode in this country. It will not
adversely affect the right of anyone now permanently settled here.
(ii) We shall end the practice of allowing permanent settlement for those who
come here for a temporary stay.
(iii) We shall limit entry of parents, grandparents and children over 18 to a
small number of urgent compassionate cases.
(iv) We shall end the concession introduced by the Labour government in 1974 to
husbands and male fiancés.
(v) We shall severely restrict the issue of work permits.
(vi) We shall introduce a Register of those Commonwealth wives and children
entitled to entry for settlement under the 1971 Immigration Act.
(vii) We shall then introduce a quota system, covering everyone outside the
European Community, to control all entry for settlement.
(viii) We shall take firm action against illegal immigrants and overstayers and
help those immigrants who genuinely wish to leave this country-but there can be
no question of compulsory repatriation.
We will encourage the improvement of language training in schools and factories
and of training facilities for the young unemployed in the ethnic communities.
But these measures will achieve little without the effective control of
immigration. That is essential for racial harmony in Britain today.
THE SUPREMACY OF PARLIAMENT
In recent years, Parliament has been weakened in two ways. First, outside groups
have been allowed to usurp some of its democratic functions. Last winter, the
Government permitted strike committees and pickets to take on powers and
responsibilities which should have been discharged by Parliament and the police.
Second, the traditional role of our legislature has suffered badly from the
growth of government over the last quarter of a century.
We will see that Parliament and no other body stands at the centre of the
nation's life and decisions, and we will seek to make it effective in its job of
controlling the Executive.
We sympathise with the approach of the all-party parliamentary committees which
put forward proposals last year for improving the way the House of Commons
legislates and scrutinises public spending and the work of government
departments. We will give the new House of Commons an early chance of coming to
a decision on these proposals.
The public has rightly grown anxious about many constitutional matters in the
last few years - partly because our opponents have proposed major constitutional
changes for party political advantage. Now Labour want not merely to abolish the
House of' Lords but to put nothing in its place. This would be a most dangerous
step. A strong Second Chamber is necessary not only to revise legislation but
also to guarantee our constitution and liberties.
It is not only the future of the Second Chamber which is at issue. We are
committed to discussions about the future government of Scotland, and have put
forward proposals for improved parliamentary control of administration in Wales.
There are other important matters, such as a possible Bill of Rights, the use of
referendums, and the relationship between Members of the European Parliament and
Westminster, which we shall wish to discuss with all parties.
NORTHERN IRELAND
We shall maintain the Union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in accordance
with the wish of the majority in the Province. Its future still depends on the
defeat of terrorism and the restoration of law and order. We shall continue with
the help of the courage, resolution and restraint of the Security Forces-to give
it the highest priority. There will be no amnesty for convicted terrorists.
In the absence of devolved government, we will seek to establish one or more
elected regional councils with a wide range of powers over local services. We
recognise that Northern Ireland's industry will continue to require government
support.
5. Helping the family
HOMES OF OUR OWN
To most people ownership means first and foremost a home of their own.
Many find it difficult today to raise the deposit for a mortgage. Our tax cuts
will help them. We shall encourage shared purchase schemes which will enable
people to buy a house or fiat on mortgage, on the basis initially of a
part-payment which they complete later when their incomes are high enough. We
should like in time to improve on existing legislation with a realistic grants
scheme to assist first-time buyers of cheaper homes. As it costs about three
times as much to subsidise a new council house as it does to give tax relief to
a home buyer, there could well be a substantial saving to the tax and ratepayer.

The prospect of very high mortgage interest rates deters some people from buying
their homes and the reality can cause acute difficulties to those who have done
so. Mortgage rates have risen steeply because of the Government's financial
mismanagement. Our plans for cutting government spending and borrowing will
lower them.
THE SALE OF COUNCIL HOUSES
Many families who live on council estates and in new towns would like to buy
their own homes but either cannot afford to or are prevented by the local
authority or the Labour government. The time has come to end these restrictions.
In the first session of the next Parliament we shall therefore give council and
new town tenants the legal right to buy their homes, while recognising the
special circumstances of rural areas and sheltered housing for the elderly.
Subject to safeguards over resale, the terms we propose would allow a discount
on market values reflecting the fact that council tenants effectively have
security of tenure. Our discounts will range from 33 per cent after three years,
rising with length of tenancy to a maximum of 50 per cent after twenty years. We
shall also ensure that 100 per cent mortgages are available for the purchase of
council and new town houses. We shall introduce a right for these tenants to
obtain limited term options on their homes so that they know in advance the
price at which they can buy, while they save the money to do so.
As far as possible, we will extend these rights to housing association tenants.
At the very least, we shall give these associations the power to sell to their
tenants.
Those council house tenants who do not wish to buy their homes will be given new
rights and responsibilities under our Tenants' Charter.
REVIVING THE PRIVATE RENTED SECTOR
As well as giving new impetus to the movement towards home ownership, we must
make better use of our existing stock of houses. Between 1973 and 1977 no fewer
than 400,000 dwellings were withdrawn from private rental. There are now
hundreds of thousands of empty properties in Britain which are not let because
the owners are deterred by legislation. We intend to introduce a new system of
shorthold tenure which will allow short fixed-term lettings of these properties
free of the most discouraging conditions of the present law. This provision will
not, of course, affect the position of existing tenants. There should also be
more flexible arrangements covering accommodation for students. At the same
time, we must try to achieve a greater take-up in rent allowances for poorer
tenants.
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT
The quality of our environment is a vital concern to all of us. The last
Conservative government had a proud record of achievement in reducing pollution,
and protecting our heritage and countryside. We shall continue to give these
issues a proper priority. Subject to the availability of resources we shall pay
particular attention to the improvement and restoration of derelict land, the
disposal and recycling of dangerous and other wastes, and reducing pollution of
our rivers and canals.
We attach particular importance to measures to reduce fuel consumption by
improving insulation.
STANDARDS IN EDUCATION
The Labour Party is still obsessed with the structure of the schools system,
paying too little regard to the quality of education. As a result we have a
system which in the view of many of our parents and teachers all too often fails
- at a cost of over £8 billion a year
- even to provide pupils with the means of communication and understanding. We
must restore to every child, regardless of background, the chance to progress as
far as his or her abilities allow.
We will halt the Labour government's policies which have led to the destruction
of good schools; keep those of proven worth; and repeal those sections of the
1976 Education Act which compel local authorities to reorganise along
comprehensive lines and restrict their freedom to take up places at independent
schools.
We shall promote higher standards of achievement in basic skills. The
Government's Assessment of Performance Unit will set national standards in
reading, writing and arithmetic, monitored by tests worked out with teachers and
others and applied locally by education authorities. The Inspectorate will be
strengthened. In teacher training there must be more emphasis on practical
skills and on maintaining discipline.
Much of our higher education in Britain has a world-wide reputation for its
quality. We shall seek to ensure that this excellence is maintained. We are
aware of the special problems associated with the need to increase the number of
high-quality entrants to the engineering professions. We shall review the
relationship between school, further education and training to see how better
use can be made of existing resources.
We recognise the valuable work done by the Youth Service and will continue to
give help to those voluntary bodies which make such a considerable contribution
in this field.
PARENTS' RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Extending parents' rights and responsibilities, including their right of choice,
will also help raise standards by giving them greater influence over education.
Our Parents' Charter will place a clear duty on government and local authorities
to take account of parents' wishes when allocating children to schools, with a
local appeals system for those dissatisfied. Schools will be required to publish
prospectuses giving details of their examination and other results.
The Direct Grant schools, abolished by Labour, gave wider opportunities for
bright children from modest backgrounds. The Direct Grant principle will
therefore be restored with an Assisted Places Scheme. Less well-off parents will
be able to claim part or all of the fees at certain schools from a special
government fund.
THE ARTS
Economic failure and Socialist policies have placed the arts under threat.
Lightening the burden of tax should in time enable the private sponsor to
flourish again and the reform of capital taxation will lessen the threat to our
heritage. We will strengthen the existing provision whereby relief from CTT is
available on assets placed in a maintenance fund for the support of heritage
property. We favour the establishment of a National Heritage Fund to help
preserve historic buildings and artistic treasures for the nation. We will
continue to give as generous support to Britain's cultural and artistic life as
the country can afford.
Sport and recreation have also been hit by inflation and high taxation. We will
continue to support the Sports Councils in the encouragement of recreation and
international sporting achievement.
HEALTH AND WELFARE
The welfare of the old, the sick, the handicapped and the deprived has also
suffered under Labour. The lack of money to improve our social services and
assist those in need can only be overcome by restoring the nation's prosperity.
But some improvements can be made now by spending what we do have more sensibly.

In our National Health Service standards are falling; there is a crisis of
morale; too often patients' needs do not come first. It is not our intention to
reduce spending on the Health Service indeed, we intend to make better use of
what resources are available. So we will simplify and decentralise the service
and cut back bureaucracy.
When resources are so tightly stretched it is folly to turn good money away from
the NHS and to discourage people from doing more for themselves. We shall
therefore allow pay-beds to be provided where there is a demand for them; end
Labour's vendetta against the private health sector; and restore tax relief on
employer-employee medical insurance schemes. The Royal Commission on the Health
Service is studying the financing of health care, and any examination of
possible longer term changes - for example greater reliance for NHS funding on
the insurance pnnciple - must await their report.
In the community, we must do more to help people to help themselves, and
families to look after their own. We must also encourage the voluntary movement
and self-help groups working in partnership with the statutory services.
MAKING SENSE OF SOCIAL SECURITY
Our social security system is now so complicated that even some Ministry
officials do not understand it. Income tax starts at such a low level that many
poor people are being taxed to pay for their own benefits. All too often they
are little or no better off at work than they are on social security.
This was one of our principal reasons for proposing a tax credit scheme. Child
benefits are a step in the right direction. Further progress will be very
difficult in the next few years, both for reasons of cost and because of
technical problems involved in the switch to computers. We shall wish to move
towards the fulfilment of our original tax credit objectives as and when
resources become available. Meanwhile we shall do all we can to find other ways
to simplify the system, restore the incentive to work, reduce the poverty trap
and bring more effective help to those in greatest need.
Restoring the will to work means, above all, cutting income tax. It also
involves bringing unemployment and short-term sickness benefit within the tax
system an objective fully shared by Labour Ministers. The rules about the
unemployed accepting available jobs will be reinforced and we shall act more
vigorously against fraud and abuse.
We welcomed the new Child Benefit as the first stage of our tax credit scheme.
One-parent families face much hardship so we will maintain the special addition
for them.
THE ELDERLY AND THE DISABLED
We will honour the increases in retirement pensions which were promised just
before the election.
However, like others, pensioners have suffered from the high taxes and
catastrophic inflation of Labour's years.
It is wrong to discourage people who wish to work after retirement age, and we
will phase out the 'earnings rule' during the next Parliament. The Christmas
Bonus, which the last Conservative government started in 1972, will continue. We
will exempt war widows' pensions from tax and provide a pension for pre-1950
widows of 'other ranks' who do not receive one at present.
Much has been done in recent years to help the disabled, but there is still a
long way to go. Our aim is to provide a coherent system of cash benefits to meet
the costs of disability, so that more disabled people can support themselves and
live normal lives. We shall work towards this as swiftly as the strength of the
economy allows.
6. A strong Britain in a free world
IMPROVING OUR DEFENCES
During the past five years the military threat to the West has grown steadily as
the Communist bloc has established virtual parity in strategic nuclear weapons
and a substantial superiority in conventional weapons. Yet Labour have cut down
our forces, weakened our defences and reduced our contribution to NATO. And the
Left are pressing for still more reductions.
We shall only be able to decide on the proper level of defence spending after
consultation in government with the Chiefs of Staff and our allies. But it is
already obvious that significant increases will be necessary. The SALT
discussions increase the importance of ensuring the continuing effectiveness of
Britain's nuclear deterrent.
In recent times our armed forces have had to deal with a wide variety of
national emergencies. They have responded magnificently despite government
neglect and a severe shortage of manpower and equipment. We will give our
servicemen decent living conditions, bring their pay up to full comparability
with their civilian counterparts immediately and keep it there. In addition, we
must maintain the efficiency of our reserve forces. We will improve their
equipment, too, and hope to increase their strength.
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
If we wish to play our full part in shaping world events over the next few
critical years, we must also work honestly and genuinely with our partners in
the European Community. There is much that we can achieve together, much more
than we can achieve alone.
There are some Community policies which need to be changed since they do not
suit Britain's - or Europe's - best interests. But it is wrong to argue, as
Labour do, that Europe has failed us. What has happened is that under Labour our
country has been prevented from taking advantage of the opportunities which
membership offers.
Labour's economic policies have blunted our competitive edge and made it more
difficult for our companies to sell in our partners' markets. What is more, the
frequently obstructive and malevolent attitude of Labour Ministers has weakened
the Community as a whole and Britain's bargaining power within it.
By forfeiting the trust of our partners, Labour have made it much more difficult
to persuade them to agree to the changes that are necessary in such important
areas as the Common Agricultural Policy, the Community budget, and the proposed
Common Fisheries Policy.
The next Conservative government will restore Britain's influence by convincing
our partners of our commitment to the Community's success. This will enable us
to protect British interests and to play a leading and constructive role in the
Community's efforts to tackle the many problems which it faces.
We shall work for a common-sense Community which resists excessive bureaucracy
and unnecessary harmonisation proposals, holding to the principles of free
enterprise which inspired its original founders.
Our policies for the reform of the CAP (see Chapter 3) would reduce the burden
which the Community budget places upon the British taxpayer. We shall also
strive to cut out waste in other Community spending programmes.
National payments into the budget should be more closely related to ability to
pay. Spending from the budget should be concentrated more strictly on policies
and projects on which it makes sense for the Community rather than nation states
to take the lead.
We attach particular importance to the co-ordination of Member States' foreign
policies. In a world dominated by the super-powers, Britain and her partners are
best able to protect their international interests and to contribute to world
peace and stability when they speak with a single voice.
AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST
In Africa and the Middle East, there is an increasing threat from the Soviet
Union and its Cuban allies. That threat must be countered, not only through
collaboration with our European and American allies but also by the people and
governments in Africa and the Middle East whose independence is threatened.
We shall do all we can to build on the Egyptian/Israeli peace treaty, to seek a
comprehensive settlement which will bring peace to the whole region.
RHODESIA
The Conservative Party will aim to achieve a lasting settlement to the Rhodesia
problem based on the democratic wishes of the people of that country. If the Six
Principles, which all British governments have supported for the last fifteen
years, are fully satisfied following the present Rhodesian Election, the next
government will have the duty to return Rhodesia to a state of legality, move to
lift sanctions, and do its utmost to ensure that the new independent state gains
international recognition.
TRADE, AID AND THE COMMONWEALTH
Like other industrial countries, Britain has a vital interest in bringing
prosperity to poorer nations which provide us with a growing market and supply
many of the raw materials upon which we depend. The next Conservative government
will help them through national and international programmes of aid and
technical co-operation and by the encouragement of voluntary work. But we also
attach particular importance to the development of trade and private investment
through such instruments as the European Community's Lomé Convention. In
particular, we will foster all our Commonwealth links and seek to harness to
greater cifret the collective influence of the Commonwealth in world affairs.
7. A new beginning
IN THIS MANIFESTO we have not sought to understate the difficulties which face
us-the economic and social problems at home, the threats to the freedom of the
West abroad. Yet success and security are attainable if we have the courage and
confidence to seize the opportunities which are open to us.
We make no lavish promises. The repeated disappointment of rising expectations
has led to a marked loss of faith in politicians' promises. Too much has gone
wrong in Britain for us to hope to put it all right in a year or so. Many things
will simply have to wait until the economy has been revived and we are once
again creating the wealth on which so much else depends.
Most people, in their hearts, know that Britain has to come to terms with
reality. They no longer have any time for politicians who try to gloss over the
harsh facts of life. Most people want to be told the truth, and to be given a
clear lead towards the action needed for recovery.
The years of make-believe and false optimism are over. It is time for a new
beginning.

British Conservative Party election manifesto, 1983CONSERVATIVE PARTY: 1983
FOREWORD - THE CHALLENGE OF OUR TIMES
In the last four years, Britain has recovered her confidence and self-respect.
We have regained the regard and admiration of other nations. We are seen today
as a people with integrity, resolve and the will to succeed.
This Manifesto describes the achievements of four years of Conservative
government and sets out our plans for our second term.
The choice before the nation is stark: either to continue our present steadfast
progress towards recovery, or to follow policies more extreme and more damaging
than those ever put forward by any previous Opposition.
We face three challenges: the defence of our country, the employment of our
people, and the prosperity of our economy.
How to defend Britain's traditional liberties and distinctive way of life is the
most vital decision that faces the people at this election.
We have enjoyed peace and security for thirty-eight years - peace with freedom
and justice. We dare not put that security at risk.
Every thinking man and woman wants to get rid of nuclear weapons. To do that we
must negotiate patiently from a position of strength, not abandon ours in
advance.
The universal problem of our time, and the most intractable, is unemployment.
The answer is not bogus social contracts and government overspending. Both, in
the end, destroy jobs. The only way to a lasting reduction in unemployment is to
make the right products at the right prices, supported by good services. The
Government's role is to keep inflation down and offer real incentives for
enterprise. As we win back customers, so we win back jobs.
We have a duty to protect the most vulnerable members of our society, many of
whom contributed to the heritage we now enjoy. We are proud of the way we have
shielded the pensioner and the National Health Service from the recession.
Only if we create wealth can we continue to do justice to the old and the sick
and the disabled. It is economic success which will provide the surest guarantee
of help for those who need it most.
Our history is the story of a free people - a great chain of people stretching
back into the past and forward into the future.
All are linked by a common belief in freedom, and in Britain's greatness. All
are aware of their own responsibility to contribute to both.
Our past is witness to their enduring courage, honesty and flair, and to their
ability to change and create. Our future will be shaped by those same qualities.

The task we face is formidable. Together, we have achieved much over the past
four years. I believe it is now right to ask for a new mandate to meet the
challenge of our times.
MARGARET THATCHER



THE ROAD TO RECOVERY
Britain is once more a force to be reckoned with. Formidable difficulties remain
to be overcome. But after four years of Conservative government, national
recovery has begun.
When we came to office in May 1979, our country was suffering both from an
economic crisis and a crisis of morale. British industry was uncompetitive,
over-taxed, over-regulated and over-manned. The British economy was plagued by
inflation. After only a brief artificial pause, it was back into double figures.
This country was drifting further and further behind its neighbours. Defeatism
was in the air.
We did not disguise the fact that putting Britain right would be an extremely
difficult task. The second sharp oil price increase and the deepest world
recession since the 1 930s have made those difficulties worse. At the same time,
the Western world is passing through another transformation from the age of the
smokestack to the era of the microchip. Traditional industries are being
transformed by the new technologies. These changes have led to a rapid rise in
unemployment in almost every Western country.
Our opponents claim that they could abolish unemployment by printing or
borrowing thousands of millions of pounds. This is a cruel deceit. Their plans
would immediately unleash a far more savage economic crisis than their last; a
crisis which would, very soon, bring more unemployment in its wake.
The truth is that unemployment, in Britain as in other countries, can be checked
and then reduced only by steadily and patiently rebuilding the economy so that
it produces the goods and services which people want to buy, at prices they can
afford.
What We Have Achieved
This is the task to which we have steadfastly applied ourselves with gradually
increasing success. Prices are rising more slowly now than at any time for
fifteen years. Britain is now among the low-inflation nations of the Western
world. Output is rising.
We are creating the conditions in which trade and industry can prosper. We have
swept away controls on wages, prices, dividends, foreign exchange, hire
purchase, and office and factory building.
We have returned to free enterprise many state firms, in order to provide better
service to the customer and save taxpayers' money.
We have cut income tax rates and raised allowances at all levels.
We have more than protected pensions against rising prices. We have strengthened
the National Health Service. We have given council tenants the right to buy
their own homes.
We have strengthened the police and the armed forces of the Crown.
We have done all this and more, and still kept our promise to bring public
spending under control.
We have paid off nearly half the overseas debts the Labour Party left behind.
Once the IMF's biggest borrower, we are now playing a leading part in
strengthening international trade and finance - to the benefit of the poorest
countries on earth.
And we have acted so that people might live in freedom and justice. The bravery,
skill and determination with which Britain's task force recaptured the Falklands
reverberated around the world. Many small nations gave thanks for that stand;
and our allies in the North Atlantic are heartened by what Britain achieved in
the South Atlantic.
Over the past four years, this country has recaptured much of her old pride. We
now have five great tasks for the future. They are:
  to create an economy which provides stable prices, lasting prosperity and
  employment for our people;
  to build a responsible society which protects the weak but also allows the
  family and the individual to flourish;
  to uphold Parliamentary democracy and strengthen the rule of law;
  to improve the quality of life in our cities and countryside;
  to defend Britain's freedom, to keep faith with our allies in Europe and in
  NATO, and to keep the peace with justice.
These tasks will require sustained determination, imagination and effort from
Government and people alike.
JOBS, PRICES AND UNIONS
During the years of recession, now coming to an end, even the most successful of
our competitors have faced increasingly serious problems and mounting
unemployment. Despite all these difficulties, the Conservative Government has
been overcoming Britain's fundamental problems: restoring sound money, setting a
better balance between trade unions and the rest of society, bringing efficiency
to the nationalised industries, and developing effective policies to mitigate
the curse of unemployment.
The foundations of recovery have been firmly laid. In the next Parliament, we
shall build on this progress.
Success Against Inflation
Steadier prices and honest money are essential conditions for recovery. Under
the last Labour government, prices doubled and inflation soared to an all-time
peak - despite the existence of a battery of controls on prices, profits,
dividends and pay.
Today, there are no such controls. Yet prices are rising more slowly than at any
time since the 1 960s. During the last year, inflation has come down faster in
Britain than in any other major economy. With lower inflation, businessmen,
families, savers and pensioners can now begin at last to plan and budget ahead
with confidence.
In the next Parliament, we shall endeavour to bring inflation lower still. Our
ultimate goal should be a society with stable prices.
We shall maintain firm control of public spending and borrowing. If Government
borrows too much, interest rates rise, and so do mortgage payments. Less
spending by Government leaves more room to reduce taxes on families and
businesses.
We shall continue to set out a responsible financial strategy which will
gradually reduce the growth of money in circulation - and so go on bringing
inflation down.
Our opponents are once again proposing the same financial policies that led to
such appalling inflation and chaos in the past.
Labour's 'National Economic Assessment' is a stale repeat of the Social Contract
which ended so disastrously in the Winter of Discontent. Once again, the Labour
Party is committed to carry out trade union leaders' instructions in exchange
for mere expressions of goodwill.
Commonsense in Pay Bargaining
With lower inflation. we have seen a return to commonsense in pay bargaining.
Uncertainty and anxiety about rising prices have contributed to the absurdly
high pay claims that destroyed so many jobs. As inflation subsides, people in
work can see the prospect of real, properly-earned improvements in their living
standards - which have gone up by more than 5 per cent on average over the last
four years. So long as sensible government policies are matched by sensible
attitudes in industry and commerce, these living standards can continue to
improve.
The last four years have shown that a bureaucratic machine for controlling wages
and prices is quite unnecessary. It simply stores up trouble and breeds
inefficiency.
But Government remains inescapably responsible for controlling its own costs. We
are committed to fair and reasonable levels of pay for those who work in the
public services. We shall therefore continue to seek sensible arrangements for
determining pay in the Civil Service and the National Health Service, following
the Megaw Report and the resolution of the NHS pay dispute.
It is equally our duty to the nation as a whole to prevent any abuse of monopoly
power or exploitation of the sick, the weak and the elderly. So we must continue
to resist unreasonable pay claims in the public sector.
Trade Union Reforms
In the return to more sensible pay bargaining, the trade unions have an
important part to play.
They can be powerful instruments for good or harm, to promote progress or hinder
change, to create new jobs or to destroy existing ones. All of us have a vital
interest in ensuring that this power is used democratically and responsibly.
Both trade union members and the general public have welcomed the 1980 and 1982
Employment Acts, which restrain secondary picketing, encourage secret ballots,
curtail abuse of the closed shop, and restore rights of redress against trade
unions responsible for committing unlawful acts.
But some trade union leaders still abuse their power against the wishes of their
members and the interests of society. Our 1982 Green Paper, Democracy in Trade
Unions, points the way to give union members control over their own unions. We
shall given union members the right to:
  hold ballots for the election of governing bodies of trade unions;
  decide periodically whether their unions should have party political funds.
We shall also curb the legal immunity of unions to call strikes without the
prior approval of those concerned through a fair and secret ballot.
Political Levy
Consultations on the Green Paper have confirmed that there is widespread
disquiet about how the right of individual trade union members not to pay the
political levy operates in practice, through the system of contracting-out. We
intend to invite the TUC to discuss the steps which the trade unions themselves
can take to ensure that individual members are freely and effectively able to
decide for themselves whether or not to pay the political levy. In the event
that the trade unions are not willing to take such steps, the Government will be
prepared to introduce measures to guarantee the free and effective right of
choice.
Essential Services
The proposal to curb immunity in the absence of pre-strike ballots will reduce
the risk of strikes in essential services. In addition, we shall consult further
about the need for industrial relations in specified essential services to be
governed by adequate procedure agreements, breach of which would deprive
industrial action of immunity. The nation is entitled to expect that the
operation of essential services should not be disrupted.
Involving Employees
Good employers involve their employees by consulting them and keeping them fully
informed. This is vital for efficiency as well as harmony in industry. We shall
continue to encourage it. Many employers have already done much in recent years
to establish a long-needed sense of common purpose with their workforces. We
shall resist current attempts to impose rigid systems of employer/employee
relations in Britain. We will continue to encourage workers to identify with the
success of the firm for which they work, by the promotion of share-ownership and
profit-sharing.
In each of the last two years, largely as a result of tax changes we have
introduced, about a quarter of a million employees have acquired shares in the
companies that employ them.
When state industries are offered to the private sector, we have given their
employees the chance to buy shares in them, and many have exercised this right.
Unemployment: Coping with Change
During the last four years, unemployment in the industrialised countries has
risen more sharply than at any time since the 1 930s. Britain has been no
exception. We have long been one of the least efficient and most over-manned of
industrialised nations. We raised our own pay far more, and our output far less,
than most of our competitors. Inevitably, this pushed prices up and drove
countless customers to buy from other countries, forcing thousands of employers
out of business and hundreds of thousands of workers out of jobs.
At the same time, there has been a rapid shift of jobs from the old industries
to the new, concentrated on services and the new technologies. Tragically, trade
unions have often obstructed these changes. All too often this has delayed and
reduced the new and better-paid jobs which could replace those that have been
lost.
This Government has an impressive record in helping the unemployed who, usually
through no fault of their own, are paying the price of these past errors.
We have committed over £2,000m. this year to training and special measures for
the unemployed. This is supported by substantial help from the European
Community's Social Fund, amounting to over £250m. in 1982. As long as
unemployment remains high, we shall maintain special measures of this kind,
which bring effective help to many of those who have no job.
This year, some 1,100,000 people are being trained or helped by the most
comprehensive programme of its kind in Europe.
For the first time, the new Enterprise Allowance Scheme offers many thousands of
unemployed people the support they need, but previously could not get, while
they start their own businesses. We will maintain special help for the long-term
unemployed through the Community Programme, and for the older unemployed through
early retirement schemes.
Removing the Barriers to Jobs
We shall go on reducing the barriers which discourage employers from recruiting
more staff, even when they want to. And we shall help to make the job market
more flexible and efficient so that more people can work part-time if they wish,
and find work more easily.
That is why we have amended the Employment Protection Act and why we shall
continue to:
  minimise the legal restrictions which discourage the creation of new jobs;
  encourage moves towards greater flexibility in working practices, such as
  Part-Time Job Release, which makes it financially possible for people nearing
  retirement age to go part-time; and the Job-Splitting Scheme which helps
  employers to split a whole-time job into two part-time jobs;
  improve the efficiency of the employment services in identifying and filling
  job vacancies;
  ensure that Wages Councils do not reduce job opportunities by forcing workers
  to charge unrealistic pay rates, or employers to offer them.
Training
If we are to make the most of the employment opportunities that present
themselves in an age of rapid change and more varied patterns of work and
occupation, up-to-date training is essential.
Training for work must start with better, more relevant education at school. For
school leavers, we have provided the most imaginative and far-reaching scheme in
our history. The Youth Training Scheme offers every 16-year old a year of
serious training for work. It should help 350,000 youngsters by the autumn of
this year. From now on, no one leaving school at 16 need be unemployed in his
first year out of school.
This is only a part of our wider strategy to ensure effective training for the
skills and jobs of tomorrow - on a scale and of a quality to match the world's
best. At its heart is our reform of industrial training and the apprenticeship
system.
We are improving the scope and quality of our training for the employed and
unemployed alike; tackling problems which the Labour Party has never had the
courage to face.
We shall continue to provide for, and improve, the special employment and
training needs of the disabled, and to reform our training agencies to meet more
effectively the needs of industry and workers alike.
The Nationalised Industries
Reform of the nationalised industries is central to economic recovery. Most
people who work in these industries work hard and have a sense of public
service. Since 1979, we have gone to great lengths to improve the performance of
the state sector, to appoint top-class managers and work closely with them to
tackle each industry's problems.
But for all this, few people can now believe that state ownership means better
service to the customer. The old illusions have melted away. Nationalisation
does not improve job satisfaction, job security or labour relations - almost all
the serious strikes in recent years have been in state industries and services.
We have also seen how the burden of financing the state industries has kept
taxes and government borrowing higher than they need have been.
A company which has to satisfy its customers and compete to survive is more
likely to be efficient, alert to innovation, and genuinely accountable to the
public. That is why we have transferred to private ownership, in whole or in
part, Cable and Wireless, Associated British Ports, British Aerospace, Britoil,
British Rail Hotels, Amersham International, and the National Freight
Corporation. Many of their shares have been bought by their own employees and
managers, which is the truest public ownership of all.
We shall continue our programme to expose state-owned firms to real competition.
In telecommunications, we have licensed a new independent network, Mercury, and
have decided to license two mobile telephone networks. We have allowed
competition in commercial postal services. Already, standards of service are
beginning to improve. Investment is rising. And better job opportunities are
being opened up.
We shall transfer more state-owned businesses to independent ownership. Our aim
is that British Telecom - where we will sell 51 per cent of the shares to the
private sector Rolls Royce, British Airways and substantial parts of British
Steel, of British Shipbuilders and of British Leyland, and as many as possible
of Britain's airports, shall become private sector companies. We also aim to
introduce substantial private capital into the National Bus Company. As before,
we will offer shares to all those who work in them.
We shall also transfer to the private sector the remaining state-owned oil
business - the British Gas Corporation's offshore oil interests.
We have abolished the Gas Corporation's statutory monopoly of the supply of
North Sea gas to industry. Already there has been a vigorous new lease of life
for gas exploration and development in the North Sea, which had ground to a
complete halt under Labour. In the last Parliament, we passed a law to encourage
the private generation of electricity. In the next Parliament, we shall seek
other means of increasing competition in, and attracting private capital into,
the gas and electricity industries.
Merely to replace state monopolies by private ones would be to waste an historic
opportunity. So we will take steps to ensure that these new firms do not exploit
their powerful positions to the detriment of consumers or their competitors.
Those nationalised industries which cannot be privatised or organised as smaller
and more efficient units will be given top-quality management and required to
work to clear guidelines.
ENCOURAGING FREE ENTERPRISE
We want to see an economy in which firms, large and small, have every incentive
to expand by winning extra business and creating more jobs. This Conservative
Government has been both giving those incentives and clearing away the obstacles
to expansion: the high rates of tax on individuals and businesses; the
difficulties facing the small firm trying to grow, and the self-employed man
trying to set up on his own; the blockages in the planning system; the
bottlenecks on our roads; the restrictions on our farmers and fishermen; and the
resistance to new ideas and technologies.
In the last four years, many British firms have made splendid progress in
improving their competitiveness and profitability. But there is some way to go
yet before this country has regained that self-renewing capacity for growth
which once made her a great economic power, and will make her great again.
Only a government which really works to promote free enterprise can provide the
right conditions for that dream to come true.
Lower and Simpler Taxes
In the last four years, we have made great strides in reducing and simplifying
taxes. We have:
  cut the basic rate of income tax; raised tax allowances above the level we
  inherited after allowing for price rises; brought the higher rates of income
  tax down to European levels; and made big reductions in the investment income
  surcharge, which have particularly helped the old;
  removed many of the worst features of Capital Transfer Tax, Capital Gains Tax
  and Development Land Tax;
  cut business taxes, in particular the National Insurance Surcharge, Labour's
  tax on jobs, from 3½ per cent to 1 per cent; and improved stock relief for
  businesses;
  much reduced the taxes on, and increased the incentives for, gifts to
  charities;
  greatly reduced tax bureaucracy. Manpower in the Inland Revenue and Customs &
  Excise has fallen from 113,400 in April 1979 to 98,500 in April 1983, and is
  set to fall further.
This dramatic progress is all the more striking when compared with the vast
increases in taxation which our opponents' policies would inevitably bring.
The changes to this year's Finance Act on which Labour have insisted show that
they intend just this. We shall reverse those changes at the earliest
opportunity.
Further improvements in allowances and lower rates of income tax remain a high
priority, together with measures to reduce the poverty and unemployment traps.
We want to encourage wider ownership. This means lowering taxes on capital and
savings; encouraging individuals to invest directly in company shares; and
encouraging the creation of more employee share schemes.
More Small Firms
We have reduced the burdens on small firms, especially in employment legislation
and planning, and cut many of the taxes they pay, particularly Corporation Tax.
Our Loan Guarantee Scheme has already backed extra lending of over £300m. to
about 10,000 small firms. The new Business Expansion Scheme, a major extension
of the Business Start-up Scheme, will encourage outside investment in small
companies by special tax reliefs. The construction of new premises for small
businesses has more than doubled.
To help the engineering industry and the areas most dependent on it, we have
introduced and now extended a very successful scheme of grants (SEFIS) to
smaller firms, which help them to buy new machinery.
Thanks to these policies and over one hundred other important measures, the
climate for new and smaller businesses in the UK has been transformed and is now
as favourable as anywhere in the world.
Help for the New Technologies
Even during the recession, our new industries and technologies made remarkable
progress. Britain has more micro-computers in relation to its population than
any other country. We have speeded this progress by supporting research and
spreading knowledge of the technologies of tomorrow; and by increasing
government support for the new technologies from £100m. in 1978-9 to over £350m.
in 1983-4. But that is only the beginning. We will now:
  promote, in partnership with industry, the Alvey programme for research into
  advanced information technology;
  accelerate the transfer of technology from the university laboratory to the
  market place, especially by the encouragement of science parks;
  help firms to launch new products through pilot schemes and public purchasing;

  build on the successes of our 'Micros-in-Schools' scheme and our network of
  Information Technology Centres for the young unemployed so that they are
  equipped with tomorrow's skills;
  sanction the launch of new cable networks to bring wider choice to consumers,
  not just for entertainment, but for the whole new world of tele-shopping and
  tele-banking.
Regions, Enterprise Zones and Freeports
We shall continue to maintain an effective regional policy which is essential to
ease the process of change and encourage new businesses in areas which have been
dependent on declining industries. We do not propose sudden changes in regional
policy. But we will:
  make sure that these policies are economical and effective in creating genuine
  jobs;
  secure more effective co-ordination between central and local government and
  the European Community's Regional Development Fund to ensure that their
  actions offer the greatest help to communities in need;
  further develop local self-help initiatives, the 24 Enterprise Zones and, our
  latest innovation, duty-free trading zones, which will be established in
  certain experimental 'Freeports';
  diversify regional economies by encouraging the fullest use of our schemes for
  innovation.
Planning
In our crowded country the planning system has to strike a delicate balance. It
must provide for the homes and workplaces we need. It must protect the
environment in which we live.
One particular way to achieve this is by bringing back into use the thousands of
acres lying derelict and unused, so much of which is in the ownership of local
authorities or other public bodies. We have set up Land Registers to identify
this land, and we shall now use our powers to bring it into use. The more this
land can be used, the less the need to build on Green Belts and the countryside.
We will also bring open-cast coalmining within normal proper planning control,
and we shall establish more control over intensive livestock units near
residential areas.
Energy
Britain has come from nowhere to be the world's fifth largest oil producer. The
North Sea success story has been a triumph of private enterprise for the
nation's benefit. We shall continue to ensure that our taxation and licensing
policies encourage development in the North Sea.
In the next Parliament, the interests of the whole country require Britain's
massive coal industry, on which we depend for the overwhelming bulk of our
electricity generation, to return to economic viability.
We shall press ahead with the development of safe nuclear power. It is an
important way of securing lower-cost electricity for the future. We shall set up
an Energy Efficiency Office to co-ordinate the Government's conservation effort,
so as to ensure that the taxpayer gets the best value for money.
We recognise that some energy users have special needs. This is why we have:
  ensured that standing charges no longer dominate the bills of small gas and
  electricity consumers;
  increased help for the needy with their fuel bills, leading to many fewer
  disconnections;
and
  introduced more favourable terms for the energy-intensive industries.
Better Transport for Industry
The national motorway and trunk road network will continue to be developed and
improved to high-quality standards. This will not only make driving much safer
for all, but also speed and cheapen the transport of goods. We will also seek to
make rail freight more competitive.
Many of our ports have now been returned from state control to independent
ownership. We intend that they should provide profitable and efficient services
without the taxpayers' support.
Tourism
Our hotels, resorts and tourist attractions are important because they provide
hundreds of thousands of jobs, earn valuable foreign exchange, and provide
holidays for millions of our own people. We shall continue to support the
Tourist Boards and tourism projects throughout the country.
Farming and Fishing
British farming and horticulture have improved dramatically since 1979. Exports
have leapt to £2,500m. a year. Since 1978, our self-sufficiency in food has
risen by more than a sixth, from 53 per cent to 62 per cent.
In Europe, our tough negotiating stance has doubled our farmers' share of the
help available under the Common Agricultural Policy. The cost of the CAP to
British taxpayers doubled under Labour. Under us, it has been falling in real
terms. We have reversed the Labour Government's disastrous policy for the Green
Pound which harmed British farmers. At the same time, we have not neglected the
consumers' interest. Food prices more than doubled under Labour and rose faster
than other prices. Under the Conservatives, they have risen less than other
prices. Last year they grew by less than one per cent, the smallest rise for
nearly twenty years.
We have given special help to Britain's hill farmers, and agreed very worthwhile
Community schemes for beef and sheepmeat. These have all brought great benefits
to Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the uplands of England. We have
launched successfully the 'Food from Britain' campaign, which should help us
sell far more of our products both at home and in the rest of the Community.
We shall help the glasshouse industry to sell more fruit and vegetables, and to
make use of the best possible arrangements for heating and insulation.
We welcome the fact that, after long negotiations, the National Farmers' Union
and the Country Landowners' Association have agreed on the best way to make more
farm tenancies available for young people. We shall legislate on these lines at
an early opportunity. We intend to make sure that British agriculture and
horticulture continue to make the greatest possible contribution to our economic
success.
We have successfully negotiated a Common Fishing Agreement that provides British
fishermen with the greatest advantages in our waters in the industry's history.
For the first time since we joined the Community, we now have effective
conservation measures, and can look forward to expanding, rather than declining,
stocks of fish. During the next Parliament, we shall introduce measures to
restructure the fishing industry and to encourage investment and better
marketing.
RESPONSIBILITY AND THE FAMILY
Freedom and responsibility go together. The Conservative Party believes in
encouraging people to take responsibility for their own decisions. We shall
continue to return more choice to individuals and their families. That is the
way to increase personal freedom. It is also the way to improve standards in the
state services.
Conservatives believe equally strongly in the duty of Government to help those
who are least able to help themselves. We have more than carried out our pledges
to protect pensioners against price rises and to maintain standards in the
National Health Service. This rebuts the totally unfounded charge that we want
to 'dismantle the Welfare State'. We are determined that our public services
should provide the best possible value both for people they seek to help and for
the taxpayer who pays the bill.
A free and independent society is one in which the ownership of property is
spread as widely as possible. A business which is partly or wholly owned by its
workers will have more pride in performance. Already firms like the National
Freight Company, where managers and workers joined together to take over the
business, are thriving.
Under this Government, the property-owning democracy is growing fast. And the
basic foundation of it is the family home.
Housing: Towards a Home-owning Democracy
We have given every council and New Town tenant the legal right to buy his or
her own home. Many Housing Association tenants have been granted the same right,
too. This is the biggest single step towards a home-owning democracy ever taken.
It is also the largest transfer of property from the State to the individual. No
less than half a million council houses and flats were sold in the last
Parliament to the people who live in them. By our encouragement of private
housebuilding and our new range of schemes to help first-time buyers, there are
a million more owner-occupiers today than four years ago.
The Labour Party has met these proposals with vicious and prolonged resistance
and is still fighting a rearguard action against wider home ownership. A Labour
government would take away the tenant's right to buy his council house, would
prevent councils selling even voluntarily at a discount, and would force any
former tenant who wanted to sell his house to sell it back to the council.
In the next Parliament, we will give many thousand more families the chance to
buy their homes. For public sector tenants, the present 'Right to Buy' scheme
will be improved and extended to include the right to buy houses on leasehold
land and the right to buy on a shared ownership basis. The maximum discount will
be increased by one per cent a year for those who have been tenants for between
twenty and thirty years, taking the maximum discount to 60 per cent. We shall
also help first-time buyers who are not council tenants through our various
low-cost home-ownership schemes: 'homesteading', building for sale, improvement
for sale, and shared ownership.
Britain needs more homes to rent, too, in the private sector as well as the
public sector. For years, the blind prejudice of the Labour Party has cast a
political blight on privately rented housing. But our assured tenancy scheme has
encouraged builders to start building new homes to rent again, and our shorthold
scheme is helping the private sector to meet the needs of those who want
short-term rented accommodation.
We shall extend our Tenants' Charter to enable council tenants to get necessary
repairs done themselves and be reimbursed by their councils. Housing Improvement
Grants have been increased substantially in the last two years and will continue
to play an important role.
We shall conduct early public consultation of proposals which would enable the
building societies to play a fuller part in supporting the provision of new
housing and would bring up to date the laws which govern them.
Our goal is to make Britain the best housed nation in Europe.
Protecting the Pensioner
Over the last four years, the retirement pension has risen from £19.50 to £32.85
a week for a single person and from £31.20 to £52.55 for a married couple. Even
after allowing for price rises, pensioners can buy more with their pension today
than they could under the last Labour government. We have ended Labour's
unreliable system of relying on forecasts of price rises to decide by how much
to increase the pension. In five of the last seven years, those forecasts turned
out to be wrong. In future, pensions will be related to actual and not estimated
price increases.
In the next Parliament, we shall continue to protect retirement pensions and
other linked long-term benefits against rising prices. Public sector pensioners
will also continue to be protected on the basis of realistic pension
contributions. In this Parliament, we raised to £57 a week the amount pensioners
may earn without losing any of their pension. It remains our intention to
continue raising the limit and to abolish this earnings rule as soon as we can.
The Christmas Bonus, which Labour failed to pay in 1975 and 1976, will continue
to be paid every year in accordance with the law we passed in 1979.
Over 11.5m. people - half the working population - are now covered by
occupational pension schemes. We will consider how the pension rights of 'early
leavers', people who change jobs, can be better protected and how their members
may be given fuller information about their pension schemes.
Social Security
Supplementary benefits, too, have been raised ahead of prices. To encourage
thrift, instead of penalising it, the Government has also raised the amount of
savings people can keep without losing any supplementary benefit. At the same
time, we have clamped down firmly on fraud and abuse of social security.
Expenditure on cash benefits to the disabled is 21 per cent higher than under
Labour, even after allowing for rising prices. There has been extra help, too,
for those who are least able to afford their fuel bills.
We have introduced - and extended - a widows' bereavement allowance. We have
kept the war widows' pension ahead of prices and removed it from tax altogether.

Child benefit and one-parent benefit are to be raised in November to their
highest-ever level in real terms. We have also improved the family income
supplement scheme to help low-paid working families.
Our record shows the strength of our commitment. But our ability to help depends
on the wealth which the country produces. In Britain today, over 40p in every
pound of public spending is already devoted to health and social security. It is
hypocritical for the Labour party to pretend that they could raise public
spending on benefits by thousands of millions of pounds without admitting the
vast increases in taxation and national insurance contributions that would be
needed, or the increased inflation that would result.
The National Health Service
We have more than matched our pledge to maintain spending on the National Health
Service and secure proper value for money. Even after allowing for price rises,
the nation is spending substantially more on health, and getting better health
care.
By last year, there were 45,000 more nurses and midwives, and over 6,500 more
doctors and dentists, working for the NHS than in 1978. This has helped to make
it possible to treat over two million more patients a year in our hospitals.
Until last year's futile strike, waiting lists for treatment fell sharply.
We intend to continue to make sure that all patients receive the best possible
value for the money that is spent on the Health Service. The treatment of the
elderly, the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill will continue to make
extra provision for those parts of the country in the North and the Midlands
which have always been comparatively short of resources.
Unlike the last Labour government which actually cut the hospital building
programme by one-third, we have committed £1,100m. to our large-scale programme
for building new hospitals. There are now 140 new hospitals in that programme
being designed or built. We shall continue to upgrade existing hospitals and
brighten up shabby wards.
To release more money for looking after patients, we will reduce the costs of
administering the Health Service. We are asking health authorities to make the
maximum possible savings by putting services like laundry, catering and hospital
cleaning out to
competitive tender. We are tightening up, too, on management costs, and getting
much firmer control of staff numbers.
Most people who are ill or frail would prefer to stay in or near their own
homes, rather than live in a hospital or institution. Helping people to stay in
familiar surroundings is the aim of our policy 'Care in the Community'. The
Government has given extra powers and extra cash to health authorities to enable
them to finance such community care for individual patients on a long-term
basis.
Partnership in Care
Conservatives reject Labour's contention that the State can and should do
everything.
We welcome the growth in private health insurance in recent years. This has both
made more health care available, and lightened the load on the NHS, particularly
for non-urgent operations. We shall continue to encourage this valuable
supplement to state care. We shall promote closer partnership between the State
and the private sectors in the exchange of facilities and of ideas in the
interests of all patients.
We also welcome the vital contribution made by voluntary organisations in the
social services. We shall continue to give them strong support. The Conservative
Government has already made many radical changes in law and taxation which have
greatly improved the way charities and voluntary bodies are financed. The terms
governing gifts under covenants have been much improved, and the liability to
capital taxation has been lightened or swept away.
We shall continue to support our highly successful 'Opportunities for
Volunteering' scheme. In the next Parliament, we shall develop other new ways to
encourage more private giving.
Schools: The Pursuit of Excellence
For a long time now, parents have been worried about standards and discipline in
many of our schools. This Conservative Government has responded to that worry
with the Parents' Charter and the 1980 Education Act. For the first time:
  local authorities were obliged to take account of parents' choice of school
  for their children;
  schools were obliged to publish prospectuses, giving details of their
  examination results;
  parents were given the right to be represented on school governing bodies;
  the Government offered Assisted Places to enable less well-off parents to send
  bright children to some of the best independent schools.
Giving parents more power is one of the most effective ways of raising
educational standards. We shall continue to seek ways of widening parental
choice and influence over their children's schooling.
We shall defend Church schools and independent schools alike against our
opponents' attacks. And we shall defend the right of parents to spend their own
money on educating their children.
This country is now spending more per child in school than ever before, even
after allowing for price rises. As a result, the average number of children per
teacher is the lowest ever. Exactly how the money is spent, and how schools are
run, is up to local education authorities.
But the Government can help improve standards and make sure that children are
taught and trained for the world they will grow up into.
  Until now, HM Inspectors' reports have remained secret. Now we are publishing
  them and making sure they are followed up, too.
  We are not satisfied with the selection or the training of our teachers. Our
  White Paper sets out an important programme for improving teacher training
  colleges.
  We shall switch the emphasis in the Education Welfare Service back to school
  attendance, so as to reduce truancy.
  We have given special help for refresher courses for teachers, research into
  special schools, and play groups and nursery schools where they are most
  needed.
  We shall also encourage schools to keep proper records of their pupils'
  achievements, buy more computers, and carry out external graded tests. The
  public examination system will be improved, and O-level standards will be
  maintained.
  We are setting up fourteen pilot projects to bring better technical education
  to teenagers. The success of these will play a vital part in raising technical
  training in Britain to the level of our best overseas competitors.
Higher Education
Our universities and polytechnics, too, must generate new ideas and train the
skilled workforce of the next generation. We have unrivalled institutions and
unrivalled inventive genius - as the number of British Nobel prize-winners
shows. What matters is to bring the two closer together and make the best
practical use of both.
Britain has more students in professional training than Japan, and a greater
proportion of young people in higher education than France or West Germany. More
of our young people are now entering full-time degree courses than under the
last Labour government. And a larger proportion of them complete their courses
than in most other countries.
The very large sums of public money now going to higher education must be spent
in the most effective way. Within that budget, we want to see a shift towards
technological, scientific and engineering courses.
  We have set aside money for 700 new posts for young lecturers over three years
  to bring new blood into research.
  Over the next three years, we will provide for more teaching and research on
  information technology, with new posts for lecturers, and 2,200 new places for
  students.
Sport and Recreation
The Government has increased the real level of funding for the Sports Council.
The Urban Aid and Derelict Land Programmes have also contributed to new sporting
projects. By these means, and by offering one pound of government money for
every one pound raised locally, we have begun to transform sports facilities in
the inner cities.But there are still plenty of sports facilities which could be
opened up to the general public. In particular, to reinforce our initiatives for
better use of schools and playing fields, we shall urge every local education
authority to make school and college premises available for use outside school
hours and in the holidays. In all these initiatives, voluntary bodies will be
enabled to play a bigger part.
We have kept up the pressure for public access to parks and reservoirs for
anglers and all those who enjoy and respect the countryside.
Safety. Quality and Value For Money
The best way to protect the consumer is to bring price rises down and keep them
down, and to increase competition. We have achieved both, and so helped the
housewife far more than any bureaucratic system of controls. We have also
brought the state industries under the scrutiny of the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission, and exposed many of them to competition to prevent them from
exploiting their customers.
We shall remain vigilant in defence of the quality and safety of the products
people buy. But we shall also reduce government intervention wherever it is
unnecessary or harmful to the interests of the customer.
The provisions of our Data Protection Bill will meet public concern that
computers pose a particular threat to privacy, and will enable us to ratify the
European Convention on Data Protection.
Supporting Family Life
It is not for the Government to try to dictate how men and women should organise
their lives. Our approach is to help people and their families fulfil their own
aspirations in a rapidly changing world. As an employer, this Government is
fulfilling its commitment to equal opportunities for men and women who work in
the public services. We have brought forward for public discussion proposals for
improving the tax treatment of married women, whether or not they go out to
work.
We are reviewing the family jurisdiction of the courts, including their
conciliation role, with a view to improving the administration of family law. We
shall also reform the divorce laws to offer further protection to children, and
to secure fairer financial arrangements when a marriage ends.
LAW, DEMOCRACY AND THE CITIZEN
The rule of law matters deeply to every one of us. Any concession to the thief,
the thug or the terrorist undermines that principle which is the foundation of
all our liberties. That is why we have remained firm in the face of the threats
of hijackers and hunger strikers alike. The defeat of the occupation of the
Iranian Embassy is only one example of our determination to be patient but still
unyielding.
Backing the Crime-Fighters
We recognised from the start the immense and continuing public concern about
lawlessness, particularly in some of our larger cities. We acted immediately to
fulfil our pledges to give the hard-pressed police every possible backing.
  The strength of the police force now stands at record levels: 9,000 extra
  policemen have been recruited in England and Wales alone since 1979. They are
  much better paid and equipped than ever before. We shall be ready to increase
  police establishments where necessary in the war against crime.
  Thousands more policemen are back on the beat, where the public wishes to see
  them, instead of being isolated in panda cars. It takes time for any reform in
  police training and methods to achieve its full effect, but already street
  crime is being reduced and public confidence improved in some of the worst
  inner-city areas.
  The proposals embodied in our Police and Criminal Evidence Bill will help the
  police to bring criminals to justice. At the same time, they will reinforce
  public support for the police by laying down clear rules for the proper
  treatment of suspects. We shall also build more courtrooms to reduce delays in
  trying criminal cases.
  Last year's Criminal Justice Act has given the courts tougher and more
  flexible sentencing powers. This Act makes parents more responsible for crimes
  committed by their children, and improves compensation for the victims of
  crime.
  Courts will also continue to impose Community Service Orders which compel
  offenders to make amends by doing useful work for the local community. We
  shall set up more compulsory attendance centres to which the courts can send
  young hooligans. The invaluable work of the Probation Service will continue to
  be supported.
  There must be enough prison places to cope with sentences imposed by the
  courts. We shall complete our major programme of building which will provide
  another 4,800 places in ten new prisons. And we are recruiting more prison
  officers to staff them.
  We will also respond to the increasing public concern over obscenity and
  offences against public decency, which often have links with serious crime. We
  propose to introduce specific legislation to deal with the most serious of
  these problems, such as the dangerous spread of violent and obscene video
  cassettes.
  We accept the case for an independent prosecution service, and will consider
  how it might best be set up.
  We intend to extend substantially the grounds that disqualify those with
  criminal records from serving on juries.
Dealing with crimes, civil disobedience, violent demonstrations and pornography
are not matters for the police alone. It is teachers and parents - and
television producers, too - who influence the moral standards of the next
generation. There must be close co-operation and understanding between the
police and the community they serve.
Immigration: Firm and Fair
We are utterly opposed to racial discrimination wherever it occurs, and we are
determined to see that there is real equality of opportunity. The Conservative
Party is, and always has been, strongly opposed to unfairness, harassment and
persecution, whether it be inspired by racial, religious or ideological motives.

To have good community relations, we have to maintain effective immigration
control. Since 1979, immigration for settlement has dropped sharply to the
lowest level since control of immigration from the Commonwealth began more than
twenty years ago. By passing the British Nationality Act, we have created a
secure system of rights and a sound basis for control in the future; and we will
continue to pursue policies which are strict but fair.
The Supremacy of Parliament
The British Constitution has outlasted most of the alternatives which have been
offered as replacements. It is because we stand firm for the supremacy of
Parliament that we are determined to keep its rules and procedures in good
repair.
We have modernised the Select Committees to improve Parliament's ability to keep
a check on the actions of the Executive. We shall continue to pursue sensible,
carefully considered reforms where they are of practical value.
Labour want to abolish the House of Lords. We will ensure that it has a secure
and effective future. A strong Second Chamber is a vital safeguard for democracy
and contributes to good government.
Northern Ireland
In Northern Ireland, building upon the courage, commitment and increasing
success of our security forces, we will give the highest priority to upholding
law and order. We will continue to give the support essential for the Province
to overcome its economic difficulties.
The people of Northern Ireland will continue to be offered a framework for
participation in local democracy and political progress through the Assembly.
There will be no change in Northern Ireland's constitutional position in the
United Kingdom without the consent of the majority of people there, and no
devolution of powers without widespread support throughout the community. We
believe that a close practical working relationship between the United Kingdom
and the Government of the Republic can contribute to peace and stability in
Northern Ireland without threatening in any way the position of the majority
community in the Province.
The Quality of Government
This country is fortunate to have a Civil Service with high standards of
administration and integrity. The Civil Service has loyally and effectively
helped to carry through the far-reaching changes we have made to secure greater
economy, efficiency and better management in Government itself. It is a tribute
to this spirit of co-operation that the number of civil servants has been
reduced from 732,000 to 649,000 with the minimum of redundancies and with higher
standards of service to the citizen. This has saved the taxpayer about £500m. a
year, and is helping us to improve civil service working conditions.
The efficiency 'scrutinies' launched by Lord Rayner and other money-saving
techniques have now identified savings worth £400m. a year to the taxpayer. We
have abolished 500 Quangos and done away with no less than 3,600 different types
of government forms.
We are successfully putting out to tender more services needed by central
government. We shall press on with this wherever public money can be saved and
standards of service maintained or improved.
Public spending is now planned in terms of hard cash instead of so-called
constant prices, and the discipline of cash limits on spending has been
extended. As a result, public spending is firmly under control.
Local Government: Saving Ratepayers' Money
We have checked the relentless growth of local government spending, and manpower
is now back down to the level of 1974. The achievement of many Conservative
authorities in saving ratepayers' money by putting services like refuse
collection out to tender has played a major part in getting better value for
money and significantly reducing the level of rate increases. We shall encourage
every possible saving by this policy.
There are, however, a number of grossly extravagant Labour authorities whose
exorbitant rate demands have caused great distress both to businesses and
domestic ratepayers. We shall legislate to curb excessive and irresponsible rate
increases by high-spending councils, and to provide a general scheme for
limitation of rate increases for all local authorities to be used if necessary.
In addition, for industry we will require local authorities to consult local
representatives of industry and commerce before setting their rates. We shall
give more businesses the right to pay by instalments. And we shall stop the
rating of empty industrial property.
The Metropolitan Councils and the Greater London Council have been shown to be a
wasteful and unnecessary tier of government. We shall abolish them and return
most of their functions to the boroughs and districts. Services which need to be
administered over a wider area - such as police and fire, and education in inner
London - will be run by joint boards of borough or district representatives.
IMPROVING OUR ENVIRONMENT
The Conservative Party has a long record of practical and effective action to
improve the quality of life in our cities and countryside and to preserve our
heritage. Since 1979, no government in Western Europe has done more for the
environment - a clumsy word for many of the things that make life worth living.
Reviving Britain's Cities
We have to cure the disastrous mistakes of decades of town-hall Socialism by
striking a better balance between public and private effort. Our approach to
reviving the rundown areas of our great cities is to use limited public money to
stimulate much larger investment by private enterprise. The £60m. we have
earmarked for the Urban Development Grant this year will be matched by up to
four times that sum from private firms investing in new developments. On
Merseyside, Operation Groundwork has brought together landowners, local industry
and local authorities to tackle the squalor and dereliction on the edge of
towns. The lessons of this and many other Merseyside initiatives will now be
applied in other urban areas.
We have encouraged people to move back into the inner cities. Builders are now
being helped to build homes of the type that young couples in particular can
afford. We shall promote this revival of our inner cities, both by new building,
and by sales by local councils of some of their rundown property to homesteaders
who will restore the homes themselves.
We shall encourage greater opportunity for all those who live in our inner
cities, including our ethnic minorities.
  Our small business schemes are helping to bring firms back into the city
  centres, and the Enterprise Zones we have set up are already bringing new life
  to some of the hardest-hit places in industrial Britain.
  We shall continue to give priority to the areas most in need. Our programme
  for the reclamation of derelict land will continue. We shall increase our
  efforts to secure the disposal of under-used public sector land, using the
  powers available to us in order to require sites to be sold for homes and
  jobs.
Public Transport
We have already taken important steps to improve the standards of public
transport. We have lifted restrictions on long-distance coach services. As a
result, about one hundred new express coach services have been started, fares
have been substantially reduced and comfort improved. We shall further relax bus
licensing to permit a wider variety of services. We shall encourage the creation
of smaller units in place of the monolithic public transport organisations which
we have inherited from the Socialist past, and encourage more flexible forms of
public transport. City buses and underground railways will still need reasonable
levels of subsidy. But greater efficiency and more private enterprise will help
keep costs down.
The GLC has grossly mismanaged London Transport. We shall set up a new London
Regional Transport Authority for the underground, buses and commuter trains in
the London area. This will provide the opportunity to split the different types
of transport into separate operating bodies, put more services out to private
tender and offer the passenger better performance.
In the country, we shall ensure better use of school and special buses for local
communities. Restrictions on minibuses will be cut. So will the red tape which
makes it so difficult for small firms and voluntary bodies to provide better
ways to get around for those without cars, particularly the very old and the
disabled.
We want to see a high-quality, efficient railway service. That does not mean
simply providing ever-larger subsidies from the taxpayer. Nor, on the other
hand, does it mean embarking upon a programme of major route closures. There is,
however, scope for substantial cost reductions in British Rail which are needed
to justify investment in a modern and efficient railway.
Fewer restrictive practices and much more attention to the customer are also
essential. Rail services are now facing vigorous competition from coaches and
cars, and they need to respond with more innovative and more modern work
methods. We shall examine ways of decentralising BR and bringing in private
enterprise to serve railway customers.
To make life more agreeable in our towns and villages, we will push ahead our
bypass programme, which will help to take more lorries away from them.
Rural Policy and Animal Welfare
Conservatives understand the need for a proper balance between the strengthening
of the rural economy and the preservation of the beauty and habitat of our
countryside.
Economic development will be encouraged in areas where this balance can be best
maintained. At the same time, we have introduced the Wildlife and Countryside
Act - the most important piece of legislation yet affecting the countryside - to
safeguard areas of natural beauty and sites of scientific interest.
We have taken the lead in the much acclaimed measures to save the whale from
extinction and to protect seals, and we shall co-operate fully in the important
international work to protect all endangered species.
Since 1979, we have been working to achieve full European agreement on the
treatment of animals. We have introduced measures to improve the conditions of
farm animals being transported or exported. There is now a European Convention
on the Protection of Animals. We welcomed this agreement, and immediately
introduced a White Paper on Animal Welfare to foreshadow changes in the law. We
now propose to introduce legislation to update the Cruelty to Animals Act 1876
which will ensure more humane treatment of laboratory animals in scientific and
industrial research. The sale of pet animals in street markets has been banned.
Controlling Pollution
We intend to remove lead from petrol, and are taking the initiative with our
European partners to achieve this at the earliest possible date. We will press
ahead with our plans to reduce lead in paints, food and drinking water.
We will continue our policy to reduce river pollution - the length of polluted
rivers has been halved in the last ten years, and this work will continue. We
shall tighten up the controls on the disposal of hazardous waste and continue to
support the movement for recycling and reclamation.
The worst problems of air pollution have been resolved. But in some areas the
levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide need to be further reduced.
The peaceful application of nuclear energy, if properly controlled (as it always
has been in this country), will be beneficial to the environment as well as to
the economy. We intend to make sure that the safety record of the British
nuclear industry continues to be second to none. The Sizewell Inquiry into
Britain's first Pressurised Water Reactor is well under way. The project will go
ahead only if both the independent inspector and the Government are satisfied it
is safe.
Arts and the Heritage
Despite the recession, this Government has strengthened its support for the best
of our heritage and for the performing arts. We have created the National
Heritage Memorial Fund, which fulfils the long-delayed wish to commemorate the
dead of two world wars in a permanent and tangible way. We are building a new
British Library. The new Commission for Ancient Monuments and Historic Buildings
will both safeguard our heritage and give more people a chance to enjoy it.
Under the Conservatives, Britain's opera, theatre and ballet continue to win
world-wide renown. And our tax changes have helped to revive the British film
industry. We shall keep up the level of government support, including a fair
share for the regions. We shall also examine ways of using the tax system to
encourage further growth in private support for the arts and the heritage.
BRITAIN IN THE WORLD
For nearly four decades, Europe has been at peace. The strength of the Western
Alliance has kept our own freedoms secure. The possession of nuclear weapons by
both sides has been an effective deterrent to another war in Europe.
The policies which our Labour opponents now propose would put at risk all this
hard-won security.
The Protection of Peace
The invasion of Afghanistan and the suppression of dissent in Poland remind us
of the true nature of the Soviet Union. It remains a threat to the liberty and
security of the West. The Soviet Union maintains massive armed forces in Europe,
and is extending its naval power throughout the world. Soviet nuclear strength
continues to grow, despite the false assurances of their propaganda machine.
Labour's support for gestures of one-sided disarmament is reckless and naive.
There is no shred of evidence to suggest that the Soviet bloc would follow such
an example.
Labour would give up Britain's nuclear deterrent and prevent the United States
from using its bases in Britain which are part of its nuclear shield over
Europe. That would shatter the NATO Alliance, and put our safety in the greatest
jeopardy.
We will fully support the negotiations to reduce the deployment of nuclear
weapons. But we will not gamble with our defence.
The Soviet Union now has over one thousand SS20 warheads, two-thirds of which
are targeted on Europe. If the Soviet Union does not recognise over the coming
months the legitimate anxieties of the West by agreeing to our proposals to
eliminate this class of weapons, we will start deploying cruise missiles by the
end of this year. Even after this, the West will remain entirely ready to
negotiate for the removal of some or all of the missiles which we deploy, on the
basis of a balanced and fair agreement with the Soviet Union.
The Western Alliance can keep the peace only if we can convince any potential
aggressor that he would have to pay an unacceptable price. To do so, NATO must
have strong conventional forces backed by a nuclear deterrent. And we in Britain
must maintain our own independent nuclear contribution to British and European
defence. At the same time, we shall continue to support all realistic efforts to
reach balanced and verifiable agreements with the Soviet Union on arms control
and disarmament.
We have substantially increased our defence expenditure in real terms. We have
honoured our promise to give our regular and reserve forces proper pay and
conditions and the equipment they need to do the job.
There could be no greater testimony to the professional dedication and the
quality of equipment of the British Armed Services than the brilliant recapture
of the Falkland Islands in just 74 days. We take pride in their achievement.
Civil Defence
Our overriding desire and policy is to go on preserving peace.
However, no responsible government can simply assume that we shall never be
attacked. To plan for civil defence is a humanitarian duty - not only against
the possibility of nuclear. but also of conventional attack.
That is why we must take steps to provide the help that could be vital for
millions. To proclaim a nuclear-free zone, as some Labour councils have, is a
delusion.
The Conservative Government has accordingly carried out a thorough review of
civil defence, brought forward new regulations to require local authorities to
provide improved protection, strengthened the UK Warning and Monitoring
Organisations, and nearly doubled spending on civil defence.
We propose to amend the Civil Defence Act 1948 to enable civil defence funds to
be used in safeguarding against peacetime emergencies as well as against hostile
attacks.
Britain in Europe
The creation of the European Community has been vital in cementing lasting peace
in Europe and ending centuries of hostility. We came to office determined to
make a success of British membership of the Community. This we have done.
Our first priority in 1979 was to cut our financial contribution to the
Community Budget to a fairer level. Labour made a song and dance about
renegotiating the terms, but had achieved nothing. The bill to British taxpayers
soared.
We have stood up for Britain's interests, and substantially reduced our net
contribution to the Community Budget. We have tenaciously sought a permanent
alternative to the annual wrangles about refunds. Until we secure a lasting
solution, we shall make sure of proper interim safeguards for this country.
Meanwhile, with the help of Conservatives in the European Parliament, we shall
continue to try to shift the Community's spending priorities away from
agriculture and towards industrial, regional and other policies which help
Britain more.
We shall continue both to oppose petty acts of Brussels bureaucracy and to seek
the removal of unnecessary restrictions on the free movement of goods and
services between member states, with proper safeguards to guarantee fair
competition.
The Labour Party wants Britain to withdraw from the Community, because it fears
that Britain cannot compete inside and that it would be easier to build a
Socialist siege economy if we withdrew. The Liberals and the SDP appear to want
Britain to stay in but never to upset our partners by speaking up forcefully.
The Conservatives reject both extreme views.
The European Community is the world's largest trading group. It is by far our
most important export market. Withdrawal would be a catastrophe for this
country. As many as two million jobs would be at risk. We would lose the great
export advantages and the attraction to overseas investors which membership now
gives us. It would be a fateful step towards isolation, at which only the Soviet
Union and her allies would rejoice.
A Trading Nation
Our most important contribution to a healthy world economy is to manage our own
affairs successfully. We shall also build on our important role in promoting
international action to encourage recovery through the IMF and other
international organisations. With the other leading industrial nations, we shall
continue with our realistic initiatives to improve currency stability in the
Western world, and assist nations with excessive debts to regain stability.
Together with the Community, we are also playing a leading part in preserving an
open world trading system, while safeguarding our most vulnerable industries.
While world trade declined last year, our exports and share of world trade
increased, and we enjoyed a healthy balance of payments surplus, despite the
pessimists who said the pound was uncompetitive. We believe in reinforcing
success. This Government has given wholehearted support to British companies
tendering for major overseas projects, and helped them secure many important
contracts in the face of the toughest competition.
We will build on these initiatives to help our exporters, and vigorously promote
the interests of British trade and industry in international negotiations -
where we have already made our presence very effectively felt. We have no
intention of becoming a dumping ground for the goods of other nations. We shall
continue to challenge other nations' unfair barriers, whether in the shape of
tariffs or trading practices.
Our Wider Role
In a troubled world, Britain is increasingly respected because we stand up for
our own interests. But we are also respected because we stand up for the cause
of freedom and the spread of prosperity throughout the world.
We resisted unprovoked aggression in the Falkland Islands, when the loyal
support of our friends throughout the world reminded us of our common heritage
of freedom. We will continue to uphold the principles for which we fought.
We shall continue to give our full support to the Commonwealth and to play an
active and constructive part at the United Nations.
Our generous but carefully controlled aid programme is both an investment in the
freedom and prosperity of the poorer countries and in a stable and expanding
world economy. That programme helps us as well as those who receive it, since
most of it is spent on British goods and services. More than many other nations,
we direct our aid to the poorest countries, particularly in the Commonwealth.
But government aid is only a part of the total help we give the developing
world. Unlike the Labour Party, we believe in permitting a free and profitable
outflow of British investment. That flow to poorer countries has now grown far
larger than British Government aid, bringing with it an invaluable transfer of
skills and technology.
THE RESOLUTE APPROACH
This Government's approach is straightforward and resolute. We mean what we say.
We face the truth, even when it is painful. And we stick to our purpose.
Most decisions worth taking are difficult. Cutting a clear path through the
jungle of a modern bureaucracy is hard going. The world recession of the past
four years, and the high level of unemployment throughout the industrial world,
have made the going harder.
During these difficult years, we have protected the sick and the elderly. We
have maintained Britain's defences and her contribution to the Western Alliance.
And at the same time, we have laid the foundations for a dynamic and prosperous
future.
The rewards are beginning to appear. If we continue on our present course with
courage and commonsense, those rewards should multiply in the next five years.
We shall never lose sight of the British traditions of fairness and tolerance.
We are also determined to revive those other British qualities - a genius for
invention and a spirit of enterprise.
Under Conservative government, confidence is brushing aside pessimism at home.
Abroad, Britain is regarded for the first time in years as a country with a
great future as well as a great past.
We mean to make that future a reality.

British Conservative Party election manifesto, 1987CONSERVATIVE PARTY: 1987
The Next Moves Forward



FOREWORD
In the last eight years our country has changed - changed for the better.
We have discovered a new strength and a new pride. We have fostered a new spirit
of enterprise. We have risen to fresh challenges at home and abroad. Once again
our economy is strong. Our industries are flourishing. Unemployment is falling.
Founded on this new prosperity, we are building a better Health Service and
providing more care for those in need. Living standards are higher than ever
before. Our people have the protection of a stronger defence and more police.
Britain has come right by her own efforts. We trusted in the character and
talents of our people. The British instinct is for choice and independence.
Given the opportunities provided by Conservative policies, many more families
now enjoy the pride of ownership of homes, of shares and of pensions.
Together we are building One Nation of free, prosperous and responsible families
and people. A Conservative dream is at last becoming a reality.
This Manifesto points the way forward.
MARGARET THATCHER



THE BRITISH REVIVAL
This manifesto sets out our vision for the Britain of the 1990s and beyond, a
future based on the aspirations of millions of individuals and their families
their hopes, their needs, their security. For the first time in a generation
this country looks forward to an era of real prosperity and fulfilment.
A vast change separates the Britain of today from the Britain of the late 1970s.
Is it really only such a short time ago that inflation rose to an annual rate of
27 per cent? That the leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union was
widely seen as the most powerful man in the land? That a minority Labour
Government, staggering from crisis to crisis on borrowed money, was nonetheless
maintained in power by the Liberal Party in return for the paper concession of a
Lib-Lab pact? And that Labour's much-vaunted pay pact with the unions collapsed
in the industrial anarchy of the ""winter of discontent"", n which the dead went
unburied, rubbish piled up in the streets and the country was gripped by a
creeping paralysis which Labour was powerless to cure?
It seems in retrospect to be the history of another country. Yet these things
happened and people had to accept them as an unavoidable part of everyday life.
Reversing the Decline
Remember the conventional wisdom of the day. The British people were
""ungovernable"". We were in the grip of an incurable ""British disease"". Britain
was heading for ""irreversible decline"".
Well, the people were not ungovernable, the disease was not incurable, the
decline has been reversed.
  Britain today is in the seventh successive year of steady economic growth. We
  have moved from the bottom to the top of the growth league of major European
  countries.
  In Britain today. inflation has reached its lowest levels for almost twenty
  years.
  In Britain today, the number of strikes has dropped to the lowest levels for
  50 years.
  In Britain today. far from being in debt to the IMF, we have built up our net
  overseas assets to their highest level since the Second World War - higher
  than France, Germany and the United States, second only to Japan.
  In Britain today. living standards are higher than ever before in our history.

But these are bald statistics. What matters is the feel of the country - the new
enthusiasm for enterprise, the new spirit that Britain can make it, that we can
prosper with the best. Investment in British industry is rising strongly. Our
services sector, employing almost two-thirds of our workforce, generates a vast
surplus of foreign earnings. And our manufacturers are travelling the globe with
a new confidence born of the knowledge that Britain is internationally
competitive again.
The World Stage
This national revival is not confined to increased economic strength. Britain is
also playing a major part on the international stage. From the White House
through Europe to the Kremlin our voice is heard on arms control, on East-West
issues, on human rights, on the Middle East and on African affairs.
With the Conservative Government, Britain has played a strong and responsible
role internationally. We have defended civilised values by fighting terrorism
relentlessly. We have secured our national interests, as when we liberated the
Falklands. We have been ready to settle long-standing issues like Hong Kong
where we reached an agreement to safeguard the way of life of the people.
Time and again we have shown that we possess the essential requirements of
successful diplomacy: we stand firm on principles yet are ready to negotiate and
prepared to take decisive action.
Founded in Strength
The ability to act internationally does not come without effort. It must be
founded on a strong economy and a robust defence. This Government took the
necessary steps to build up both. Success has followed.
  Prudent financial policies have made Britain one of the world's largest
  creditors. Today we are able to shape world efforts to sustain trade and
  promote international monetary co-operation.
  We gave a lead in NATO and installed Cruise missiles. Today, as a result, the
  Soviet Union is at last prepared to negotiate to remove its own missiles
  targeted against us.
  This Government is modernising our own independent deterrent. Today Britain
  retains an independent influence in arms control negotiations between the
  superpowers.
By such steadfastness, we have not only rebuilt our economy and re-established
our world reputation; we have also regained our national self-respect. But
restoring a country's greatness is not easy. The new Conservative policies met
bitter resistance every step of the way.
Remember:
The year-long coal strike, with its violence and intimidation on a massive
scale. It failed and mining productivity has since soared.
The battle we had to fight to ensure that Britain paid no more than its fair
share of the European Community Budget. We now get automatic rebates - this
year, over £1.3 billion.
The doubling of the oil price which confronted the new Government with a
world-wide recession - and, more recently, an equally dramatic fall in the oil
price which halved government oil revenues and in earlier times would have
threatened a collapse of confidence in the pound. Both these oil ""shocks"" were
successfully withstood by prudent policies wl1ich have produced a sustained
growth of prosperity.
And let us not forget the challenge of the Falklands War.
How many of the alternative governments on offer would have stood firm,
overcome, or even survived such difficulties? Does anyone suppose that the
Labour Party would have resisted, let alone defeated, the violence and
intimidation in the coal strike? Or that the Liberals or the Social Democrats
would have fought so hard for our rebate from the Europ6an Community? Or that
any of the Opposition parties would have persevered through all these
difficulties to break the back of inflation and restore honest money?
A Strong and Stable Government
How has it been done? All these improvements in the wealth and standing of our
country have only been possible because we have had a strong government with
sound policies and a decisive majority in Parliament. A weak government with
uncertain policies would not have known how to withstand the pressures upon it;
a government without a good overall majority in Parliament would not have been
allowed to do so; and a strong government with unso1ind policies would have been
a positive force for disaster.
In this election, only the Conservative Party is offering strong, decisive and
united government.
The Next Moves Forward
The next Conservative Government will build on the achievements of the past
eight years with a full programme of positive reform.
We will continue:
  to pursue policies of sound financial management, the conquest of inflation,
  the promotion of enterprise and the growth of employment;
  to spread the ownership of homes, shares, pensions and savings ever more
  widely to give families greater financial independence;
  to give people greater choice and responsibility over their own lives in
  important areas such as housing and education;
  to improve the well-being of the people through better health care, and to
  safeguard the living standards of those who have to depend on the community;
  to improve the quality of life by conserving the best of our heritage and our
  countryside, and by fostering provision for the arts and sport;
  to exercise strong leadership where government needs to be strong in
  protecting the nation against potential aggression and the citizen against
  lawlessness.
We intend to press on with the radical Conservative reform which we embarked
upon in 1979, and which has already revived the spirit of our people and
restored the reputation of our country.
WIDER OWNERSHIP AND GREATER OPPORTUNITY
Conservatives aim to extend as widely as possible the opportunity to own
property and build up capital, to exercise real choice in education, and to
develop economic independence and security.
Our goal is a capital-owning democracy of people and families who exercise power
over their own lives n the most direct way. They would take the important
decisions - as tenants, home-owners, parents, employees, and trade unionists
rather than having them taken for them.
Of course, it is not possible to give people independence. That is something we
must all achieve by our own efforts. But what this Conservative Government has
done is to make it easier for people to acquire independence for themselves:
  by introducing the right to buy council houses;
  by returning nationalised industries to the people in ways that encourage the
  widest possible spread of ownership;
  by making it easier to buy shares in British industry through employee share
  schemes and Personal Equity Plans.
These opportunities - all too often introduced n the teeth of fierce resistance
from the Opposition parties - have achieved spectacular results. There has been
a surge of home- ownership, share-ownership and self-reliance.
And because these first-time shareholders and home-owners are more independent,
they develop a more independent outlook. They are no longer content that some of
the most important decisions in their lives what school their children attend,
for example, or whether or not to go on strike should be taken by officialdom or
trade union bosses. People want to decide such things for themselves.
In this way the scope of individual responsibility is widened, the family is
strengthened, and voluntary bodies flourish. State power is checked and
opportunities are spread throughout society. Ownership and independence cease to
be the privileges of a few and become the birthright of all.
In this way One Nation is finally reached not by a single people being
conscripted into an organised socialist programme but by millions of people
building their own lives in their own way.
Better Housing for All
HOME OWNERSHIP
Nowhere has the spread of ownership been more significant than in housing.
Buying their own home is the first step most people take towards building up
capital to hand down to their children and grandchildren. It gives people a
stake in society - something to conserve. It is the foundation stone of a
capital-owning democracy.
A home should be a source of pride and independence to the family living in it,
regardless of whether it is owned or rented. We will ensure that every family in
the land has the opportunity to make it so.
Home-ownership has been the great success story of housing policy in the last
eight years. One million council tenants have become home-owners and another one
and a half million more families have become home-owners for the first time.
Two out of every three homes are now owned by the people who live in them. This
is a very high proportion, one of the largest in the world. We are determined to
make it larger still.
Some people are still deterred by the costs and complications of house purchase.
That is why we must look for new ways to make house-buying simpler and easier.
Our abolition of the conveyancing monopoly has already made it cheaper.
We will keep the present system of mortgage tax relief.
We will target improvement grants to where they are most needed - to the least
well- off. To meet the special needs of old people, we will ensure that all
local authorities have powers to give improvement grants, where necessary, for
properties where elderly people move in with relatives. We will extend the 30
per cent housing association grant to help schemes for old people.
A RIGHT TO RENT
Most problems in housing now arise in the rented sector. Controls, although
well-meant, have dramatically reduced the private rented accommodation to a mere
8 per cent of the housing market.
This restricts housing choice and hinders the economy. People looking for work
cannot easily move to a different area to do so. Those who find work may not be
able to find rented accommodation nearby. Those who would prefer to rent rather
than buy are forced to become reluctant owner-occupiers or to swell the queue
for council houses. Some may even become temporarily homeless.
And it is not only these people and their families who suffer from the shortage
of homes for rent. The economy as a whole is damaged when workers cannot move to
fill jobs because there are no homes to rent in the neighbourhood.
This must be remedied. We have already taken some modest steps in this direction
by making it easier to part-own and part-rent homes through shared ownership; by
bringing in and widening the scheme for assured tenancies; by our system of
shortholds; and by providing a new 30 per cent housing association grant to
build hostels for young workers. We have also directly tackled the problem of
homelessness through new grants to housing associations and other measures.
More must now be done. The next Conservative Government, having already
implemented the right to buy, will increase practical opportunities to rent.
We must attract new private investment into rented housing - both from large
institutions such as building societies and housing associations as well as from
small private landlords. To do this we intend, in particular, to build on two
initiatives we have already taken,
First, to encourage more investment by institutions, we will extend the system
of assured tenancies. This will permit new lettings in which rents and the
period of lease will be freely agreed between tenants and landlords. The tenant
will have security of tenure and will renegotiate the rent at the end of the
lease, with provision for arbitration if necessary.
Second, to encourage new lettings by smaller landlords, we will develop the
system of shorthold. The rents of landlords will be limited to a reasonable rate
of return, and the tenant's security of tenure will be limited to the term of
the lease, which would be not less than 6 months. This will bring back into use
many of the 550,000 private dwellings which now stand empty because of controls,
as well as making the provision of new rented housing a more attractive
investment.
And we will revise the housing benefit system to ensure that it prevents
landlords from increasing rents to unreasonable levels at the taxpayer's
expense.
All existing private and housing association tenants will continue to have their
present protection in respect of rents and security of tenure.
We will strengthen the law against harassment and unlawful eviction.
RIGHTS FOR COUNCIL TENANTS
Many council estates built in the sixties and seventies are badly designed,
vulnerable to crime and vandalism and in bad repair. In many areas, rent arrears
are high. In all, over 110,000 council dwellings stand empty. Yet it is often
difficult for tenants to move. If they are ever to enjoy the prospect of
independence, municipal monopoly must be replaced by choice in renting.
We will give groups of tenants the right to form tenant co-operatives, owning
and running their management and budget for themselves. They will also have the
right to ask other institutions to take over their housing. Tenants who wish to
remain with the local authority will be able to do so.
We will give each council house tenant individually the right to transfer the
ownership of his or her house to a housing association or other independent,
approved landlord.
In some areas more may be necessary. The success of Estate Action and Housing
Action Areas shows how a carefully targeted approach can transform an area of
poor housing and give people there new hope. Our Urban Development Corporations
have been successful in restoring derelict industrial areas. We believe that a
similar approach could be adopted for housing in some places. We will take
powers to create Housing Action Trusts initially as a pilot scheme to take over
such housing, renovate it, and pass it on to different tenures and ownerships
including housing associations, tenant co-operatives, owner-occupiers or
approved private landlords.
We will reform the structure of local authority housing accounts so that public
funds are directed at the problems of repair and renovation; maintenance and
management are improved; resources are directed to the areas where the problems
are greatest; rent arrears are reduced; and fewer houses are left empty.
Housing is the biggest single investment that most people make - whether in
money or in time, skill and effort. In the last eight years, as a result of our
policies, we have seen a dramatic increase in home-ownership. In the next five
years, we will complement that with policies designed to improve the supply and
condition of the rented housing stock.
A Capital-Owning Democracy
SHARE OWNERSHIP
Home-ownership leads naturally to other forms of financial provision for the
future - notably to pensions and share-ownership. Half of the working population
are in occupational pension schemes, but in 1979 only seven per cent of the
population held shares.
People were deterred by the sheer unfamiliarity of owning shares. Young people
were reluctant to save for a retirement which seemed far away. And most tax
incentives encouraged saving through institutions rather than directly.
With a Conservative Government, all that has been changing. We were determined
to make share-ownership available to the whole nation. Just as with cars,
television sets, washing machines and foreign holidays, it would no longer be a
privilege of the few; it would become the expectation of the many. We achieved
this historic transformation in three ways:
First, we introduced major tax incentives for employee share-ownership. Seven
out of the last eight budgets have included measures to encourage people to
purchase shares in the company in which they work.
Second, starting this year, we brought in Personal Equity Plans, which enable
people to invest in British industry entirely free of tax.
Third, we embarked on a major programme of privatisation, insisting that small
investors and employees of the privatised companies should have a fair chance to
join in the buying.
The results have been dramatic, and the direct consequence of government policy.
Share ownership has trebled. Almost one in five of the adult population now own
shares directly. And the figure will continue to rise. Of this total, the
majority are first-time shareholders and most of them own shares in either
privatised companies or the TSB group. One-and-a-half million people hold shares
in the companies where they work.
After eight years of Conservative Government, Britain is now at the forefront of
a world wide revolution in extending ownership. One in every five British adults
now owns shares compared to one in ten Frenchmen and one in twenty Japanese.
Only the Americans, where a quarter of the people are shareholders, remain ahead
- and the gap is narrowing.
This is the first stage of a profound and progressive social transformation -
popular capitalism. Owning a direct stake in industry not only enhances personal
independence; it also gives a heightened sense of involvement and pride in
British business. More realistic attitudes to profit and investment take root.
And the foundations of British economic achievement are further strengthened.
We will press on with the encouragement of popular capitalism.
In the next Parliament:
  We will continue to extend share-ownership as we have done with
  home-ownership.
  We will reintroduce our proposed tax incentives for profit-related pay.
  We will privatise more state industries in ways that increase share-ownership,
  both for the employees and for the public at large.
Raising Standards in Education
Parents want schools to provide their children with the knowledge, training and
character that will fit them for today's world. They want them to be taught
basic educational skills, They want schools that will encourage moral values:
honesty, hard work and responsibility. And they should have the right to choose
those schools which do these things for their children.
RAISING STANDARDS IN OUR SCHOOLS
How can all this best be done? Resources obviously matter. This Government has
provided more resources for pupils than ever before.
With the Conservatives:
  Spending per primary pupil has risen by 17 per cent after allowing for
  inflation and per secondary pupil by 20 per cent under our Government.
  There are more teachers in proportion to pupils than ever before.
  British schools are world leaders in the use of computers in the classroom.
But money alone is not enough. Increased resources have not produced uniformly
higher standards. Parents and employers are rightly concerned that not enough
children master the basic skills, that some of what is taught seems irrelevant
to a good education and that standards of personal discipline and aspirations
are too low. In certain cases education is used for political indoctrination and
sexual propaganda. The time has now come for school reform.
FOUR MAJOR REFORMS
First, we will establish a National Core Curriculum.
It is vital to ensure that all pupils between the ages of 5 to 16 study a basic
range of subjects - including maths, English and science. In each of these basic
subjects syllabuses will be published and attainment levels set so that the
progress of pupils can be assessed at around ages 7, 11 and 14, and in
preparation for the GCSE at 16. Parents, teachers and pupils will then know how
well each child is doing. We will consult widely among those concerned n
establishing the curriculum.
Second, within five years governing bodies and head teachers of all secondary
schools and many primary schools will be given control over their own budgets.
They know best the needs of their school. With this independence they will
manage their resources and decide their priorities, covering the cost of books,
equipment, maintenance and staff. Several pilot schemes for financial devolution
to schools have already proved their worth, such as those in Cambridgeshire and
Solihull.
Third, we will increase parental choice.
The most consistent pressure for high standard in schools comes from parents.
They have a powerful incentive to ensure that their children receive a good
education. We have already done much through the 1980 and 1986 Education Acts so
that parents can make their voice heard. But parents still need better
opportunities to send their children to the school of their choice. That would
be the best guarantee of higher standards. To achieve this:
We will ensure that Local Education Authorities (LEAs) set school budgets in
line with the number of pupils who will be attending each school.
Schools will be required to enrol children up to the school's physical capacity
instead of artificially restricting pupil numbers, as can happen today. Popular
schools, which have earned parental support by offering good education, will
then be able to expand beyond present pupil numbers.
These steps will compel schools to respond to the views of parents. But there
must also be variety of educational provision so that parents can better compare
one school with another.
We will therefore support the co-existence of a variety of schools -
comprehensive, grammar, secondary modern, voluntary controlled and aided,
independent, sixth form and tertiary colleges as well as the reasonable rights
of schools to retain their sixth forms, all of which will give parents greater
choice and lead to higher standards.
We will establish a pilot network of City Technology Colleges. Already two have
been announced and support for more has been pledged by industrial sponsors.
We will expand the Assisted Places Scheme to 35,000. This highly successful
scheme has enabled 25,000 talented children from less-well-off backgrounds to
gain places at the 230 independent schools currently in the scheme.
We will continue to defend the right to independent education as part of a free
society. It is under threat from all the other parties.
Fourth, we will allow state schools to opt out of LEA control.
If, in a particular school, parents and governing bodies wish to become
independent of the LEA, they will be given the choice to do so. Those schools
which opt out of LEA control will receive a full grant direct from the
Department of Education and Science. They would become independent charitable
trusts.
In the area covered by the Inner London Education Authority, where entire
borough councils wish to become independent of the LEA, they will be able to
submit proposals to the Secretary of State requesting permission to take over
the provision of education within their boundaries.
VILLAGE SCHOOLS
We recognise the important contribution made by small rural primary schools to
education and to the community life of our villages. We will ensure, therefore,
that the future of these schools is judged by wider factors than merely the
number of pupils attending them.
PRE-SCHOOL EDUCATION
Eighty per cent of all three- and four-year-olds in this country attend nursery
classes, reception classes or playgroups. Formal nursery education is not
necessarily the most appropriate experience for children. Diversity of provision
is desirable. LEAs should look to support the voluntary sector alongside their
own provision.
A BETTER CAREER FOR TEACHERS
We recognise the importance of teachers and wish to enhance their professional
status. The Government has provided a record amount of money to increase their
pay by an average 16.4 per cent this year 25 per cent over 18 months. Our new
pay award will encourage able young people to enter the career of teaching and
reward the many good teachers already in the profession.
The Burnham negotiating machinery finally broke down and has been temporarily
replaced by an Interim Advisory Committee. The Government wants an effective and
permanent machinery for settling teachers' pay, in which the interests of all
parties will be recognised.
The Government will produce a Green Paper setting out the various alternatives
and will enter into wide consultations with a view to establishing a new and
effective machinery.
Higher and Further Education
The British system of higher education is among the best in the world. It ranges
from universities to further education colleges providing skills and
qualifications. We recognise the value of research and scholarship for their own
sake. At the same time we must meet the nation's demand for highly qualified
manpower to compete in international markets.
Building on our achievements since 1979 - 157,000 more full-time and part-time
students we want to expand higher education opportunities still further. By
1990, we plan to increase student numbers by a further 50,000, and to raise the
proportion of 18-year-olds in higher education.
We will replace the University Grants Committee with an independent statutory
body on the lines recommended by the Croham Committee. The new body will be
called the Universities Funding Council (UFC) and will have broadly equal
numbers of academic and non-academic members with a chairman who has substantial
experience outside the academic world. The primary responsibility of the UFC
will be the allocation of funds to individual universities under new contractual
arrangements.
Polytechnics are today strong, successful and mature institutions. They are
complementary to the universities. Their present structure, under local
authorities, is inappropriate for an expanding national role.
As part of our policy to delegate power and responsibility, we will legislate to
convert the polytechnics and other mainly higher education colleges in England
to free-standing corporate bodies under boards of governors.
We will set up a new Polytechnics and Colleges Funding Council independent of
central Government, in place of local authority control.
As part of our aim to widen access to higher education we have begun a review of
student support which is the most generous in the western world. We need to
modernise this system which has not changed for 25 years. The purpose of the
review is to improve the overall prospects of students so that more are
encouraged to enter higher education. No final conclusions have been reached,
but we believe that top-up loans to supplement grants are one way, among others,
of bringing in new finance to help students and relieve pressure on their
parents.
We will take care to ensure that the best aspects of the present system are
retained in any new proposals which we bring forward.
Trade Unions
It is not only in relation to government, however, that people's right to choice
and independence must be safeguarded and extended. Great social institutions can
sometimes become too powerful and cease to represent their members, denying them
any control over the decisions taken in their name and even forcing them to act
against their own interests. That was the case with trade unions before 1979.
Since then, Conservative reforms have redressed the balance between the
individual and his union, preventing coercion of the majority by activists and
militants. These highly successful and popular measures have encouraged
democracy within the unions, restrained the abuses of secondary action and
picketing, reversed the growth of closed shops, restored the rights of redress
against unions acting unlawfully and removed the immunity of unions that call a
strike without a fair ballot.
The result has been a transformation of shopfloor relations, allowing management
and workforce to co-operate to improve working practices and introduce new
technology to mutual gain. In the next Parliament we will protect the rights of
individual trade union members.
We will introduce legislation to:
  empower individual members to stop their unions calling them out on strike
  without first holding a secret ballot of members;
  protect individual members from disciplinary action if they refuse to join a
  strike they disagree with;
  ensure that all members of trade union governing bodies are elected by secret
  ballot at least once every five years;
  make independently supervised postal ballots compulsory for such elections;
  limit further the abuse of the closed shop by providing protection against
  unfair dismissal for all non-union employees, and removing any legal immunity
  from industrial action to establish or enforce a closed shop;
  provide new safeguards on the use of union funds;
  establish a new trade union commissioner with the power to help individual
  trade unionists to enforce their fundamental rights.
BUILDING PROSPERITY AND EMPLOYMENT
Since this Government took office in 1979, we have restored honest money and
established a stable economic framework in which business can flourish. We have
been careful not to spend money before we earned it. We have brought the nation
back to living within its means. We have massively rebuilt our international
assets. We have refused to be drawn into an auction of pledges for higher
spending that the country simply could not afford. We have balanced the books.
We have paid our way.
The results have been dramatic.
  Despite the coal strike and the collapse of the oil price, Britain has moved
  from being bottom to the top of the growth league of major European countries.

  Inflation has reached its lowest levels for almost 20 years.
  The basic rate of income tax has been cut from 33p to 27p, four taxes have
  been abolished, and almost a million and a half people have been taken out of
  income tax altogether.
  Over a million extra jobs have been created since 1983 more than in the rest
  of the European Community put together.
  Unemployment, a problem throughout Europe, is now firmly on a downward trend -
  with youth unemployment in this country below the European average.
  We have rebuilt our net overseas assets to some £110 billion from a mere £12
  billion when we first took office. This will provide substantial foreign
  earnings in the years ahead and a cushion, should oil revenues fall.
While the Opposition parties cling to the failed policies of the past, our
strategy has become widely accepted abroad. Socialist Spain as well as Christian
Democratic Germany, Social Democratic Sweden as well as France, Labour New
Zealand and Conservative Canada, all accept that governments must reduce their
borrowing, curb state spending, reduce taxation, privatise state firms and do
away with unnecessary controls. What we began in 1979 is today common
international practice.
Stable Prices
Our greatest economic challenge on entering office was to defeat inflation.
Rampant inflation under the Labour Government, when money lost a quarter of its
value in a single year, had reduced our economy to ""the sick man of Europe"".
Nothing erodes a country's competitive edge faster than inflation. Nothing so
undermines personal thrift and independence as to see the value of a lifetime's
savings eaten away in retirement through spiralling prices. And nothing
threatens the social fabric of a nation more than the conflicts and divisiveness
which inflation creates.
Our success in the battle against inflation has been the key to Britain's
economic revival. It required firm control of public expenditure, a substantial
reduction in government borrowing, curbing the growth of money in circulation,
maintaining financial discipline, stimulating competition and moderating trade
union power.
The Opposition parties opposed nearly every aspect of this strategy. If even
some of their policies were implemented today, higher borrowing and higher
spending would once again unleash inflation.
There is no better yardstick of a party's fitness to govern that its attitude to
inflation. Nothing is so politically immoral as a party that ignores that
yardstick.
The Conservative Government will continue to put the conquest of inflation as
our first objective. We will not be content until we have stable prices, with
inflation eradicated altogether.
Lower Taxes
We are the only Party that believes in lower taxation.
As the Party determined to achieve growing prosperity we recognise that it is
people who create wealth, not governments. Lower taxation coupled with lower
inflation makes everyone better off. It encourages people to work harder, to be
inventive and to take risks. It promotes a climate of enterprise and initiative.

Lower tax on earnings enables people to build up savings to give them financial
security in later life.
Lower taxation, by increasing take-home pay without adding to industry's costs,
improves competitiveness and helps with jobs. And tax relief for charitable
donations encourages more people to give and to give more generously.
There is a strong moral case for reducing taxation. High taxes deprive people of
their independence and make their choices for them. The desire to do better for
one's family is one of the strongest motives in human nature. As a party
committed to the family and opposed to the over-powerful State, we want people
to keep more of what they earn, and to have more freedom of choice about what
they do for themselves, their families and for others less fortunate.
Governments should trust people to spend their own money sensibly and decently;
high taxation prevents them doing so.
That is why we have:
  cut the basic rate of tax from 33p to 27p in the £, and increased the personal
  allowances (the starting point for paying tax) by 22 per cent more than
  inflation.
  If Labour's tax regime were still in force, the family man on average earnings
  would today be paying more than £500 per year in extra income tax: a
  headmaster married to a nurse would be paying more than £1,300 extra;
  reduced sharply the absurd top rates of tax inherited from Labour which were
  causing so many of our most talented people to work abroad;
  increased greatly the tax relief for charitable donations. Giving to charities
  has doubled since we first took office;
  abolished four taxes completely: the national insurance surcharge - the tax
  which Labour put on jobs - the investment income surcharge, the development
  land tax and the lifetime gifts tax;
  reformed and simplified corporation tax, and cut its rate to the lowest of any
  major industrial country;
  cut the small business corporation tax rate by more than a third, and extended
  it to many more small businesses;
  reformed and reduced capital taxes as well as slashing stamp duty.
In every case where taxes have been reformed and reduced there has been an
increase in the amount of tax collected.
Labour totally fail to understand the benefits this brings to everyone. Today
they openly threaten to raise taxation. To fulfil their plans, they would have
to raise taxes substantially. Indeed, all the Opposition parties Labour,
Liberals and SDP - would raise taxation. We believe that it is precisely the
wrong thing to do.
It will be our aim to do the opposite.
In the next Parliament:
  We aim to reduce the burden of taxation.
  In particular, we will cut income tax still further and reduce the basic rate
  to 25p in the £ as soon as we prudently can.
  We will continue the process of tax reform.
Spending We Can Afford
Over the past eight years we have managed the nation's finances with care. Even
allowing for inflation, this has enabled us to spend substantially more on the
Health Service (up by 31 per cent), defence (up by 23 per cent), roads (up by 17
per cent), education per pupil (up by 18 per cent), the police and the battle
against crime (up by 47 per cent), the disabled and long-term sick (up by 72 per
cent), and government training schemes (up by 120 per cent).
How have we been able to do this without running into the financial crises which
Labour's spending policies invariably set off?
First, we have been prudent with the nation's money. We have slashed public
borrowing and sought savings in government expenditure wherever they could
sensibly be found.
Second, we are engaged in steadily reducing the share of the nation's income
taken by the State. This means that more will be left for families and for
business to invest - the only safe route to higher growth in the economy.
Third, we have constantly improved the efficiency of the public services,
ensuring that we get more value for every pound spent.
For the next Parliament:
  Our aim is to ensure that public expenditure takes a steadily smaller share of
  our national income.
  Within that objective, we will continue to spend more on our priorities. We
  have set out our plans for further increased spending in these areas over the
  next three years.
CREATING NEW JOBS
High unemployment is one of the most intractable problems facing all Western
industrialised countries.
We understand the anxiety and stress which unemployment can cause. For almost a
year unemployment in the United Kingdom has fallen faster than among any of our
major competitors in Europe, and faster than at any time since 1973. It is
falling because of the growth and enterprise we have achieved, assisted by the
employment and training programmes we have developed.
Since we were last re-elected in 1983, the number of jobs has risen by over 1
million more than in the rest of the European Community put together. This
Government has established the conditions in which business can prosper and
create new jobs. This has not just been achieved through the revitalisation of
traditional industries. We have encouraged growth in those crucial areas of new
enterprise which provide the foundation for the jobs of the future -
self-employment, small firms, the creation of new enterprise, the expanding
service sector - particularly tourism and leisure - and new technology.
Self-employment is the seedcorn of the new enterprises of tomorrow. Without
sufficient people to start new businesses, the future of our whole economy is in
jeopardy. Today we have the highest number of self-employed for over 60 years.
One worker in ten is now his own boss - or her own boss, since a quarter of the
self-employed are women. Indeed, the eighties have seen almost three-quarters of
a million people become self-employed. More and more of our young people today
seek self-employment as a worthwhile career. It is particularly encouraging that
almost half the growth in self-employment since 1983 has been in the northern
part of our country.
Small firms, along with all businesses, have benefited from our management of
the economy. Since this Government took office, the number of registered
businesses has shown a net increase of more than 500 a week - and the number has
increased in every region of the country.
Helping Unemployed People into Jobs
As well as creating a climate in which business could employ more people, we
have developed programmes to help those out of work.
The Youth Training Scheme (YTS) caters for school-leavers aged 16 and 1 7 who
wish to participate in training and work experience. Every trainee is given the
opportunity of working towards a recognised qualification.
The new Job Training Scheme (JTS), which started in April this year, will offer
a chance to any person over 18 who has been unemployed for six months or more,
who wants to work and train with an employer for a recognised qualification.
This year it will help nearly a quarter of a million people.
Under our Community Programme, each year over 300,000 people who have been out
of work for some time gain valuable experience working on community projects.
They have a reference to show potential employers.
We will improve the Community Programme to make it full-time and better able to
help those with families. We shall pay those working on the programme an
allowance giving a premium over and above their social security payments.
Under the Enterprise Allowance Scheme, 230,000 unemployed people have started to
work for themselves. Many of them have now become employers themselves.
JobClubs were first opened in 1985 to help the unemployed help themselves back
into jobs. Over 1,000 have been established. At present two-thirds of those
leaving JobClubs go into employment.
The JobClubs programme has been a great success. We aim to expand it.
Our economic success means that we can now do more to help those out of work.
Although youth unemployment has declined in the last year it still remains a
problem. Far too many of our youngsters leave school with an education that has
failed to prepare them for the world of work. At the same time, by maintaining
high starting wages comparable to those of fully trained craftsmen, trade unions
have kept many of them out of work.
In 1983 we introduced the first Youth Training Scheme. It is now a national
two-year programme aimed at giving young people qualifications for work.
THE FIRST GUARANTEE
We will now guarantee a place on the Youth Training Scheme to every
school-leaver under 18 who is not going directly into a job.
As a result, none of these school-leavers need be unemployed. They can remain at
school, move to college, get a job, or receive a guaranteed training. YTS will
serve as a bridge between school and work.
We will take steps to ensure that those under 18 who deliberately choose to
remain unemployed are not eligible for benefit. We will of course continue to
protect other young people, such as those who suffer from disabilities.
THE SECOND GUARANTEE
There are still too many young people without the right qualifications for
employment in today's world.
Within a year we aim to guarantee a place, either on the Job Training Scheme or
on the Enterprise Allowance Scheme or in a JobClub, for everyone aged between 1
8 and 25 years who has been unemployed for between six and twelve months.
THE THIRD GUARANTEE
In addition to these major programmes we have taken one further important step.
Restart is a programme we have set up for interviewing and counselling the
long-term unemployed to help them into a job or training. Everyone who has been
unemployed for more than one year has already been given an interview.
We will guarantee to provide the Restart service in the future at six-monthly
intervals, to all those who have been unemployed for more than six months.
Over the next five years we will aim, through the Restart interviews, to offer
everyone who is under 50, and who has been unemployed for more than two years, a
place in the Job Training Scheme or in the new Community Programme, in a JobClub
or in the Enterprise Allowance Scheme.
REGIONAL ASSISTANCE
Money spent on earlier programmes attracting firms to regions has sometimes
created very few jobs. Our new system of regional assistance, introduced in
1984, ensures that aid is directly targeted towards the creation of new jobs.
New activities in the service sector from which so many of the new jobs come
have also been made eligible for assistance. Under the new policy, offers of
assistance have already been made which should secure almost 300,000 jobs. We
will continue to ensure that assistance is directed where it is most needed.
The Employment and Training Services
We will take further steps to provide a comprehensive service to the unemployed.
We will consult the Manpower Services Commission about transferring JobCentres
to the Department of Employment so that they can work more closely with
Unemployment Benefit Offices.
The Manpower Services Commission would then become primarily a training agency.
It is employers who are best equipped to assess their training needs.
We will increase employer representation on the Commission and its advisory
bodies.
More jobs are being created by business and industry. Nothing would destroy
whole industries more effectively than a return to the overmanning and
restrictive practices of the 1970s. Our policies form a practical and realistic
approach to help people back into work. We will build on prosperity to create
more employment.
A FRAMEWORK FOR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY
British business is in a healthier state than it has been for a generation.
Output has been rising steadily for six years. Productivity has increased at a
rate second only to Japan. Company profitability is at its highest for over
twenty years. Industry has a confidence in the future that would have been
unthinkable seven years ago.
Moreover, setting new records has not been confined to the private sector. Since
1983 productivity in the coal industry has risen by over 50 per cent. British
Steel has more than doubled its productivity since 1979 and made a profit last
year for the first time in over ten years. British Rail will cost the taxpayer
25 per cent less in subsidy this year than n 1983 and without any major route
closures.
The Conservative Government has created a framework in which once again
enterprise can flourish - by cutting red tape, by denationalising state-owned
companies, by r4moving unnecessary restrictions, by abolishing exchange control,
by enabling the City of London to become the foremost financial centre in the
world, by keeping down prices through extending competition, and by ensuring
access to open trade so that British exporters and consumers can both benefit.
Privatisation
Over a third of the companies and industries which used to be owned by the State
have been returned to free enterprise. Productivity and profitability have
soared in the newly privatised companies.
  In 1980 Jaguar made 14,000 cars a year, losing well over £3,000 on each Car
  sold. Now the company is hard put to keep up with overseas demand and last
  year sold over 40,00 cars, making a pre-tax profit of over £120m.
  Since the National Freight Consortium was sold to management and staff in
  1982, pre-tax profits have increased sevenfold.
  British Aerospace, Cable & Wireless, Amersham International and Associated
  British Ports have all strikingly increased their profits.
It is no mystery why privatisation has succeeded. The overwhelming majority of
employees have become shareholders in the newly privatised companies. They want
their companies to succeed. Their companies have been released from the detailed
controls of Whitehall and given more freedom to manage their own affairs. And
they have been exposed to the full commercial disciplines of the customer. Even
former monopolies now face increased competition.
We will continue the successful programme of privatisation.
In particular, after the privatisation of the British Airports Authority we will
return to the public the Water Authorities, leaving certain functions to a new
National Rivers Authority.
Following the success of gas privatisation, with the benefits it brought to
employees and millions of consumers, we will bring forward proposals for
privatising the electricity industry subject to proper regulation.
Competition
Competition forces the economy to respond to the needs of the consumer. It
promotes efficiency, holds down costs, drives companies to innovate and ensures
that customers get the best possible value for money.
Accordingly, this Government has:
  deregulated long-distance coach services creating over 700 new services with
  improved quality and lower fares;
  removed the monopoly on conveyancing of houses in England and Wales;
  removed the opticians' monopoly, making it easier and cheaper to buy
  spectacles;
  relaxed advertising controls on accountants, solicitors, stockbrokers and
  vets, and permitted greater fee competition for architects and surveyors;
  increased competition on air routes within the UK and between certain European
  countries, which has resulted in cheaper fares, a more responsive service and
  greater choice of carriers for the passenger;
  deregulated telecommunications, so that customers can now choose between
  suppliers when buying telephones and private exchanges, and business can
  choose between two alternative telecommunications networks;
  suspended the Post Office monopoly of time-sensitive and valuable mail,
  stimulating a dramatic increase in the number of private courier companies.
We will continue this approach.
But competition must be supplemented by legal protection for consumers. Those
who make their living from their ideas and creations also require protection
against theft.
We will introduce further measures to impose tighter controls on pyramid
selling.
We will introduce measures to reform the law on copyright, design and
performance protection.
The City
The City of London is the world's leading market place in foreign exchange,
international bank lending and international insurance, It is a major source of
funds for British companies. The financial services sector as a whole accounts
for nearly 6 per cent of our national income, generates a net £7 billion per
year to our balance of payments, and employs over one million people.
Like other sections of British industry, however, the City was held back by
restrictive practices until they were swept away in last year's ""big bang"". This
has brought nearer the day when shares can be bought and sold over the counter
in every high street. We have also given building societies greater freedom to
make a wider range of financial services available to the average family.
At the same time, the Conservative Government has introduced a legal framework
to protect investors and consumers:
  The Companies Acts of 1980 and 1981 strengthened the powers of investigators
  and increased the courts' power to disqualify directors for misconduct in the
  City as elsewhere.
  The Insolvency Act of 1985 made it easier to disqualify directors who had been
  guilty of unlawful trading.
  And now the Financial Services Act of 1986 provides the first comprehensive
  system of investor protection we have had in this country. It also contains
  stringent new powers to investigate insider dealing which was first made a
  criminal offence by the Conservative Government in 1980.
The Conservative Party is the party of law and order. That applies just as much
to City fraud as to street crime.
Parliament has just approved our proposals for establishing a Serious Fraud
Office to improve the work of investigating and prosecuting the worst cases of
fraud and for streamlining court procedure. After the election we will
reintroduce our proposals to reform the outdated rules on evidence, as
recommended by the Roskill Committee.
Trade
Britain exports 30 per cent of all that it produces. If this country is to
remain a key trading nation, industry must remain competitive. That is one
reason why the Conservative Government attaches great value to maintaining an
open multinational trading system. Another is that increased trade is a major
way of encouraging growth and prosperity in the Third World. There is little
point in demanding more aid for these countries and then refusing them the
opportunity to trade.
We will continue to fight for free and fair trade in international negotiations
and resist the growth of protectionism.
We will press for international rules of fair trading to be extended to
international investment, trade in services and the protection of intellectual
property such as patents, trademarks and copyright.
We will continue to exert pressure on countries such as Japan to open up their
markets and provide the same freedom to trade for our exporters as they expect
us to provide for theirs.
As well as creating the commercial and legal framework in which industry can
flourish, the Government must also ensure that the practical services on which
industry and the citizen rely - transport, energy, research and development, and
an efficient civil service - are provided to a high standard.
Efficient Transport
The Conservative Government is proud of a record that has:
  modernised the transport system by investing over £10 billion in the nation's
  motorways, roads, airports, seaports and railways;
  since 1979 completed over 680 miles of motorway and trunk roads and 67
  bypasses;
  secured greater efficiency by privatising British Airways, the National
  Freight Corporation, Sealink and Associated British Ports;
  increased competition by deregulating long-distance coach services and
  abolishing local bus licensing.
These measures have laid the foundations of an efficient and more flexible
transport system. We will develop it further along these lines. We are now
returning the nationalised bus companies to the private sector in many cases to
management buy-outs. We are also privatising the former British Airports
Authority the world's leading international airports group.
We are committed to a major capital investment programme through:
  new investment to build an extra 450 miles of motorway and trunk roads to
  1989/90;
  British Rail's plans to invest £500m a year over the next 3 years;
  private sector financing, construction and operation of the Dartford Bridge
  and the Channel tunnel.
Energy
Britain is the only major Western industrial country that is a net exporter of
energy. This owes much to North Sea oil so successfully developed by free
enterprise. But it is an advantage that will not last indefinitely.
Coal will continue to meet much of the steadily rising demand for electricity.
Renewable sources of energy can make some contribution to the nation's energy
needs, which is why government-sponsored research has been increased.
Nevertheless, to reject, as our opponents do, the contribution of nuclear energy
to supplying reliable, low-cost electricity, and to depend on coal alone, would
be short-sighted and irresponsible.
The world's resources of fossil fuels will come under increasing strain during
the 21st century; so may the global environment if the build-up of carbon
dioxide the so-called ""greenhouse effect"" significantly raises temperatures and
changes climates.
After the most careful and painstaking independent assessment of the safety case
for a new pressurised water reactor at Sizewell, therefore, the Government has
decided to proceed with the next phase of our nuclear programme. It is vital
that we continue to give the highest priority to safety. Our nuclear industry
has a record of safety and technical excellence second to none.
We intend to go on playing a leading role in the task of developing abundant,
low-cost supplies of nuclear electricity, and managing the associated waste
products.
Science and R & D
Government support for research and development amounts to more than £4½ billion
per year. It is larger as a share of our national income than that of the United
States, Japan or Germany. A country of our size cannot afford to do everything.
These resources need to be better targeted. The task of government is to support
basic research and to contribute where business cannot realistically be expected
to carry all the risks.
We will ensure that government spending is firmly directed towards areas of high
national priority, by extending the role of the Advisory Council on Applied
Research and Development, drawing on the full range of advice from the academic
community and from business.
The Civil Service
We have long had in this country a professional and dedicated public service
which is the envy of the world. We are now building on those traditional
qualities which can too easily be taken for granted with new strengths and
skills: a greater readiness to adapt efficiently to change, including
technological change, to manage the public service more effectively, and to see
that the taxpayer gets value for money. The size of the Civil Service at under
600,000 people today is the smallest since the war. This is already saving the
taxpayer £1 billion a year.
We will press on with long-term management reforms in order to improve public
services and reduce their cost.
AGRICULTURE AND THE RURAL ECONOMY
Farming
Britain's farmers serve the nation well. They produce 80 per cent of the food we
grow compared with 60 per cent only 10 years ago. They have made us into the
world's sixth largest exporter of cereals when we had been a net importer for
decades before. They look after 80 per cent of the British countryside. And
consumer food prices have risen less than the cost of living, unlike the Labour
years.
But farmers world-wide are under pressure because of rising surpluses and the
huge costs of disposing of them. It is just as much in the farmers' interest as
in the consumers' and taxpayers' that this over-production be stopped and a
radical overhaul of the Common Agricultural Policy achieved. Farmers need a more
sustainable environment in which to plan ahead.
We will continue:
  to play a leading part in European Community negotiations to reform the CAP;
  to strive for even-handed and fair treatment between Member States and between
  the different regions of the UK;
  to work for an early devaluation of the Green Pound, especially in relation to
  beef; to uphold the interests of the efficient family farm;
  to reduce costs and tackle surpluses, by bringing supply and demand in the
  Community
  into better balance by a combination of measures including price restraint;
  to reduce the role for intervention, At home we will continue:
  to promote competitiveness and innovation in British farming and horticulture;

  to give particular assistance to farmers in the Less Favoured Areas, recently
  extended, where farming is difficult;
  to encourage better marketing of agricultural and horticultural products and
  to ensure that the consumer has as much information about the contents of food
  as is necessary to make sensible choices.
We will not introduce rating on agricultural land and will oppose two-tier
pricing in the CAP, which would greatly disadvantage our farmers and benefit
their competitors.
The Rural Economy
Farming is, and will remain, the major industry in the countryside and food
production will continue to be the farmer's basic purpose. The higher production
resulting from greater efficiency and modern techniques initially means more
land coming out of agriculture. A new balance of policies has to be struck, with
less support for expanding production of commodities already in over-supply and
more support for diversifying into other activities.
We have recognised the new needs of the countryside and rural economies in two
ways. First, we now place more emphasis on support for the environment and the
beauty of the countryside; we now give grants to plant hedgerows, not dig them
up. Second, we encourage alternative uses of land and more diverse job
opportunities to maintain thriving communities in the rural economy.
We will therefore:
  emphasise environmental protection and promotion of non-farming rural
  businesses in the planning system;
  continue to support the Development Commission in developing rural
  enterprises;
  extend the Environmentally Sensitive Areas scheme which makes conservation a
  more integral part of farming;
  introduce new schemes to assist diversification of new enterprises on farms;
  introduce a new Farm Woodland Scheme to assist alternative land use.
The UK Fishing Industry
Our fishing industry supplies two-thirds of the fish we eat. It is an important
source of jobs and income in many areas.
The Government's success in further improving the Common Fisheries Policy has
meant that international policing has been made more effective; and increasingly
stringent conservation measures have secured the future for our fleets.
We will introduce legislation to ensure that UK quotas are reserved for UK
fishermen. We are pledged to measures to enable our fishermen to take full
advantage of all their opportunities and to improve and modernise their boats.
Animal Welfare
The Conservatives have a proud record over the years of promoting animal
welfare. Most of the legislation was either initiated by Conservative
governments or introduced as Private Members' measures by Conservative MPs when
the Conservatives were in office.
Since 1979 we have:
  set up the Farm Animal Welfare Council which advises the Government on the
  welfare of farm animals. We will continue to care for them with the advice and
  guidance of the Farm Animal Welfare Council;
  honoured our commitment to replace the 1876 legislation with the Animals
  (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 - the most effective in Europe. It imposes
  tight new controls on the use of animals for experiments. The number of
  experiments has declined in each of the last nine years, and we expect that
  decline to continue.
BETTER HEALTH, BETTER CARE
Achievements in Health
The health of the British people is steadily improving. Quite simply, we live
longer. Life expectancy has increased and infant mortality has declined.
Over the last eight years the Government has spent more on the Health Service
than any previous government, Labour or Conservative. In 1979, the outgoing
Labour Government planned to spend less than £8 billion on the nation's health.
This year, the Conservative Government will spend nearly £21 billion. After
allowing for inflation, that is an increase of almost a third. This extra money
has been spent wisely and well. The Health Service today is treating more
patients than ever before in its history.
Money is important, but the success of the NHS depends still more on the
dedication of the people working in it. There are over 75,000 more doctors,
dentists and nurses than in 1978. These extra staff have enabled the NHS to
treat 6 million more patient cases - in-patients, day cases, out-patients than
when we took office. Sometimes they work in very difficult conditions. That is
why the Government has reduced nurses' basic hours from 40 to 37 1/2 hours per
week and increased their pay by 30 per cent after allowing for inflation.
We will continue to improve the Health Service.
Future Tasks for the Health Service
Our policies rest on six principles:
First, we will give greater emphasis to the prevention of avoidable illness and
the promotion of good health to make the NHS more truly a health service and not
merely a sickness service.
Much progress has been made in the past eight years.
  The improvement of the maternity services has helped to reduce by a third the
  death rate among babies in the weeks around birth.
  The expansion of vaccination and immunisation has prevented illness and death
  among children.
  Screening for cervical cancer has been improved and death rates from the
  disease have fallen by almost 10 per cent in the past decade.
  We have already embarked on a major campaign to tackle the problem of coronary
  heart disease.
  To fight AIDS, the Government has undertaken the biggest health education
  campaign ever seen in this country one much admired abroad and is fully
  supporting the Medical Research Council in a special programme of research
  towards treatments and vaccines.
These are welcome advances.
In the next Parliament, we will build on this work by:
  completing the network of computerised 'call and recall' systems for cervical
  cancer screening. and extending them to younger women;
  developing a national programme for breast cancer screening;
  backing the newly established and powerful Health Education Authority.
Second, we will continue to show our support for the million people working in
the NHS, of whom half are nurses.
Nurses wanted the assurance that, without recourse to strike action, they would
receive fair treatment over pay. That is why we set up the independent Nurses'
Pay Review Body. After the latest award, we will have increased nurses' pay by
30 per cent since 1979, after allowing for inflation. That compares to the
severe reduction of more than 20 per cent, which they suffered under the last
Labour Government.
Nurses also want a training and career structure which reinforces their
professionalism, rewards experience, and offers opportunities for managerial
responsibility without being removed to a distant desk. We share those views,
and will seek to further them. We are particularly keen to attract experienced
nurses back into the profession, and to encourage others to take up nursing as a
new career.
Hospital doctors and consultants, too, are a vital part of the Health Service.
We have already increased the number of consultant posts and we will continue to
work for improvements in the medical career structure.
The NHS could not function without ancillary services. Some of these cleaning,
catering, and laundry have been put out to competitive tender to enable health
authorities to select the best and most effective way of providing these
services. Savings are now approaching £100 million a year and they have gone
directly and immediately into better patient care.
We have undertaken consultation on the improvement of primary care. Our aim is
to develop the strength and flexibility of the services provided by GPs,
dentists, pharmacists, opticians and nurses who work in the community.
There are particular problems affecting health care in inner cities. Doctors and
nurses there take on a particularly tough and difficult job. We shall continue
to look for new ways of helping them and improving health care, especially
primary care in the inner cities.
Our third principle is to modernise the whole framework of the health service
its hospitals, its clinics, its equipment.
In the face of economic collapse, the last Labour Government cut the hospital
building programme by a third. This Government has embarked on the biggest
building programme ever. It will cost £3 billion. In seven years we have already
carried through over 200 major building projects from start to finish.
We will complete some 125 further major new building schemes in the next three
years, and get many more under way.
New hospitals, too, are being built in areas lacking the provision they need.
Old and inefficient Victorian buildings are being replaced with purpose-built
modern hospitals. Much modern medicine and surgery is better carried out in the
new larger hospitals, equipped with new medical technology. Wherever possible,
however, small old hospitals have found a new role as community hospitals
staffed by local GPs.
Fourth, elderly, disabled, mentally ill and mentally handicapped people, should
be cared for within the community whenever this is right for them.
In the past some people who should have been cared for in other ways have
remained in hospitals, sometimes for years. That is changing. The number of
children in long-stay hospitals for the mentally handicapped has fallen by
almost three-quarters. The number of adults in long-stay mental handicap and
mental illness hospitals has fallen by around 11 000.
This changing pattern has already brought a better life to many thousands of
people. It has the potential to do so for many thousands more. But we need to
examine carefully various alternatives to discover what is now best for
patients. We have set in hand the first ever full-scale review of community
care.
We will develop our policies in the light of its findings.
Our fifth principle is to strengthen management.
The NHS is a large and complex organisation. It needs good management. It is not
a business, but it must be run in a business-like way.
The reduction of waste and inefficiency has released hundreds of millions of
pounds for better patient care. The sale of property which the NHS no longer
needs - for example, because of new hospital developments is currently raising
£200 million a year for better health care.
We will continue to ensure that the Health Service is as efficient as possible.
But good management is not just a matter of efficiency. We value enterprise in
the public service just as much as in the private sector. We will continue to
encourage district and regional managers to devise new ways of providing better
patient care.
Finally, the ultimate purpose of the Health Service is to serve the patient:
that principle is at the heart of the Government's policy.
The time some patients have to wait for treatment is the most widespread concern
in the NHS. The Government has given priority to reducing waiting lists and
times. We have set up a special £50 million two-year programme. This year it
will give treatment to over 100,000 people who are waiting for operations. We
have set targets for more hip operations for old people, and more bone marrow
transplants for children.
Putting patients first was the theme of our consultative document on primary
care. We want the patient to have more information about services available from
family doctors so that they can make a more informed choice.
Social Security - a Fair Deal for Those in Need
We are spending about £46 billion this year on social security benefits over
£800 a year for every man, woman and child in the country. Expenditure on
pensions and other benefits has risen by £13 billion on top of inflation, since
we came into office. Most of this, an extra £9 billion, has gone to provide
better standards of help and support to more elderly people, families with
children, disabled people and those suffering long-term illness. The other £4
billion has gone to help the unemployed. But we have done more than provide
extra resources massive as the increase has been.
For the first time for 40 years the Government has undertaken an overall review
of the social security system. The review showed a social security system which
was too complex and which too often did not provide help for those most in need.
The 1986 Social Security Act tackled these problems and reformed the position so
that the system is simpler to understand and to run. It will be fairer in the
way it directs help to those who need it most. And it will be a system in which
people can look forward to independence and security in retirement.
Our policies for social security have four main aims.
First, to ensure that those in retirement have a secure standard of living
through state provision and their own pensions and savings.
This Government has honoured its pledges to the pensioner and more than
maintained the buying power of the state pension. Total spending on state
pensions and benefits for elderly people has risen by 29 per cent after allowing
for inflation.
We will continue to maintain the value of the state retirement pension.
But retired people value their independence. They do not want to rely on the
State alone for their income nor, increasingly, are they doing so. We share
Beveridge's original goal of a good basic pension from the State, together with
a second income from occupational and personal pensions and savings.
Pensioners have benefited from our success against inflation. Almost
three-quarters of all pensioners have savings. Their income from these has grown
by over 7 per cent on average every year since 1979. Income from savings fell by
3Y2 per cent every year under the last Labour Government, eaten away by
inflation.
Occupational pensions, pensioners' savings, social security benefits and the
state retirement pension have all increased. The total increase in income for
the average pensioner is more than double that achieved during the last Labour
Government.
We are now offering new opportunities for people to obtain additional pensions
from their jobs or their own savings. We have already improved the treatment of
those now retiring early and of the pension rights of people changing jobs.
We wish to encourage the 10 million employees who do not yet have their own
occupational pension scheme to have a pension of their own. Every employee
should have the right to take out a personal pension, fully portable from job to
job. That is why we are extending favourable tax treatment from employers'
schemes to personal pensions.
As a result of these reforms, millions more people will have the opportunity to
take out additional pensions of their own.
In the next Parliament:
We will reintroduce measures to give substantial tax incentives to personal
pensions, and to enable members of occupational schemes to make additional
voluntary contributions to a pension plan that is completely separate from their
employers' schemes. These measures will further increase choice for millions of
employees.
Second, to bring more help to low income families.
Child benefit will continue to be paid as now, and direct to the mother.
Families on income support which replaces supplementary benefit will benefit
from the new family premium. In addition, we will introduce the new family
credit which will benefit twice as many low income families in work as family
income supplement. The new system will also help tackle both the unemployment
and the poverty traps.
Third, to improve the framework of benefits for disabled people.
Spending on benefits for disabled people and those suffering long-term sickness
has been increased by 72 per cent after inflation to £6 billion. The amount
spent on mobility allowances has been doubled, invalid care allowance extended,
the new severe disablement allowance introduced and the invalidity trap
abolished. The introduction of the new disablement premiums will bring an extra
£50 million per year to disabled people.
We are carrying out a major new survey of the needs of disabled people. This
will be completed next year.
Fourth, to reform the tangled web of income-related benefits which has grown up
piecemeal over forty years.
For the first time all the income-related benefits will be calculated in the
same way. Where people are working, the amount of benefit they get will depend
on their pay after tax and national insurance contributions. Thus people will
not be made worse off by taking a job and will not lose money when their gross
pay rises.
The new rules, which come into effect in April next year, will be easier for
claimants to understand and staff to run. In addition, our programme of
computerisation - the biggest programme ever in this country will help staff to
deliver benefits to all who are entitled to them quickly, accurately and
courteously.
Success in social policy depends on growth in national prosperity. Labour's
economic failure led to damaging cuts in health care and benefits. Our
increasing economic strength means that resources for care have grown and are
growing - with programmes better managed, better adapted to changing demands,
and better directed to those most in need.
FREEDOM, LAW AND RESPONSIBILITY
Conservatives have always believed that a fundamental purpose of government is
to protect the security of the citizen under the rule of law. There can be no
half-heartedness, no opting out, in the fight against crime and violence: all of
us, not just the Government or the police, share a responsibility to make safer
our streets and homes.
The Fight Against Crime
We do not underrate the challenge. Crime has been rising steadily over the
years; not just in Britain but in most other countries, too. The origins of
crime lie deep in society: in families where parents do not support or control
their children; in schools where discipline is poor; and in the wider world
where violence is glamorised and traditional values are under attack.
Government alone cannot tackle such deep-rooted problems easily or quickly. But
Government must give a lead: by backing, not attacking the police; by providing
a tough legal framework for sentencing; by building the prisons in which to
place those who pose a threat to society - and by keeping out of prison those
who do not; and by encouraging local communities to prevent crime and to help
the police detect it. All this we have done; and we will intensify these
efforts.
  The manpower available to the police has been increased by 16,500 since 1979.
  We have given the police more powers to avert public disorder.
  We have encouraged tougher sentences for violent criminals. The maximum
  penalties for trafficking in hard drugs and for attempted rape have been
  raised to life imprisonment. The courts have been empowered to strip drug
  traffickers of their profits.
  We have brought forward a number of reforms to help tackle child abuse and
  make it more likely that offenders will be successfully prosecuted.
  We have embarked on the biggest prison building and modernisation programme
  this century and increased staff numbers by almost a fifth.
Care for the Innocent
At the same time we have extended protection for innocent people and for the
victims of crime.
  We have strengthened the safeguards against any abuse of police power by
  setting up an independent police Complaints Authority, providing for the
  tape-recording of police interviews and setting down clear rules on the proper
  treatment of the individual citizen.
  We have given special priority to helping the victims of crime. Police
  treatment of rape victims has been made more sensitive. More criminals now pay
  compensation to their victims. We are providing more money to help local
  Victim Support Schemes.
  We have launched a determined drive to improve the administration of justice
  by providing for time limits by which the cases of those held in custody must
  be heard. 58 more Circuit Judges have been appointed and 43 court building
  projects have been completed.
Better Justice
The challenge before us remains great; but much has been done. The great
majority of those who commit serious crimes of violence are brought to book.
There are more police, better equipped to fight crime. Those who commit serious
crimes can now expect much tougher punishment.
Early in the new Parliament the Criminal Justice Bill will have to be
reintroduced. It will:
  enable child victims of physical and sexual abuse to give evidence by a live
  video link n order to reduce the anguish which they would otherwise face;
  raise to life imprisonment the penalty for carrying firearms while committing
  a crime;
  tackle, by providing for reference to the Court of Appeal, the problem of
  lenient sentences which undermine public confidence in the criminal justice
  system;
  give victims of crime a statutory right to compensation under the Criminal
  Injuries Compensation Scheme;
  build on our previous measures stripping drug traffickers of the proceeds of
  their crimes and extend the same approach to other serious crimes.
We have already signed an extradition treaty with the United States which will
make it more difficult for terrorists to escape British justice: now we will
reform our own law on extradition so as to make still more effective the
international war against crime.
Building on Strength
We will continue to put a high priority on the fight against crime, so that the
citizen can feel safe on the street or in his home.
We will:
  increase the number of police further to ensure a stronger police presence on
  our streets, to combat crime and to protect the public;
  strengthen the law dealing with the sale and possession of offensive weapons;
  maintain the operational independence of the police and resist pressure from
  the Opposition parties to politicise the police by letting local authorities
  decide policing priorities;
  continue our present prison building programme and achieve more professional
  and efficient working practices in the prison service;
  institute a thorough review of the workings of the parole system.
Our approach in all these cases is strongly supported by the general public. We
will go further in drawing on that support by promoting crime prevention.
Already more than 29,000 Neighbourhood Watch Schemes have sprung up since the
last Election. We are committed to the success of this popular anti-crime
movement.
We will build on the support of the public by establishing a national
organisation to promote the best practices in local crime prevention
initiatives.
We will seek ways to strengthen the special constabulary.
Tackling Drug Abuse
We have taken the battle against drugs into every corner of the globe where
production or trafficking flourishes. We have more than doubled the number of
customs specialist drug investigators. We have strengthened the effectiveness of
the police in the fight against drug abuse. Traffickers can now be sentenced to
life imprisonment. They also stand to lose all the wealth generated by their
evil trade under the most far-reaching asset seizure provisions anywhere in the
world.
We have funded about 200 new drug treatment facilities. Our prevention campaign,
targeted on youngsters at risk, is encouraging a strong resistance to hard drugs
amongst teenagers.
The battle against drugs can and must be won. Already there are some signs that
the heroin problem may have passed its peak. The cocaine explosion has never
happened. It need never happen.
We will continue to make the defeat of the drug trade a key priority.
Immigration and Race Relations
Immigration for settlement is now at its lowest level since control of
Commonwealth immigration first began in 1962. Firm but fair immigration controls
are essential for harmonious and improving community relations.
We will tighten the existing law to ensure that the control over settlement
becomes even more effective.
We now require visas for visitors from the Indian sub-continent, Nigeria and
Ghana, both to protect genuine travellers and to guard against bogus visitors
seeking to settle here illegally. We are tackling the problem of those who
fraudulently pose as refugees and who seek to exploit Britain's long tradition
of giving refuse to the victims of persecution.
We want to see members of the ethnic minorities assuming positions of leadership
alongside their fellow citizens and accepting their full share of
responsibility. Racial discrimination is an injustice and can have no place in a
tolerant and civilised society. We are particularly concerned about racial
attacks. They require effective and sympathetic attention from the police and we
have ensured that increasingly they receive it.
Progress towards better community relations must be on a basis of equality.
Reverse discrimination is itself an injustice and if it were to be introduced it
would undermine the achievement and example of those who had risen on their
merits.
Immigrant communities have already shown that it is possible to play an active
and influential role in the mainstream of British life without losing one's
distinctive cultural traditions. We also want to see all ethnic minorities
participating fully in British culture. They will suffer permanent disadvantage
if they remain in linguistic and cultural ghettos.
Reforming the Law
Since the last election the Government has made a number of important reforms of
family law. These cover the law of maintenance and distribution of property
following divorce, measures to prevent the abduction of children and the law of
illegitimacy.
Particular laws which are not enforced or which are full of obvious anomalies
risk bringing the law itself into disrepute. Changing tastes also require the
reform of outdated laws which govern personal habits and behaviour: such reform
should where possible be on the basis of a wide consensus.
The present laws on Sunday trading and licensing contain innumerable anomalies.
They are frequently flouted.
We will therefore look for an acceptable way forward to bring sense and
consistency to the law on Sunday trading.
And we will liberalise the laws on liquor licensing hours so as to increase
consumer choice, but we will also keep a sensible limit on late-night opening.
We have already extended absent voting rights to new categories of electors. In
particular we have enfranchised British citizens who have lived abroad for less
than 5 years.
We propose to extend this eligibility.
Northern Ireland
The British people have shown their commitment to the people of Northern Ireland
in the common fight against terrorism, and in helping improve the economic and
social situation in the Province. We resolutely support the security forces in
their outstanding service to the whole community.
We are determined that terrorism will not succeed; that the vital principles of
democracy will be upheld; and that the people of Northern Ireland themselves
should determine their constitutional position.
We will maintain, against Socialist opposition, for as long as is necessary the
special powers which the police need throughout the UK to prevent terrorism and
bring terrorists to justice.
There will be no change in the present status of Northern Ireland as part of the
United Kingdom unless the people of Northern Ireland so wish it.
That is at the heart of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which was signed with the
Republic of Ireland in 1985. The Agreement offers reassurance to both sides of
the community that their identities and interests will be respected, and that
any change in the status of Northern Ireland would only come about with the
consent of a majority of the people of the Province. It commits both governments
to work together in the fight against terrorism.
We will continue to work within the Province for a devolved government in which
both communities can have confidence and will feel able to participate.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND INNER CITIES
The Conservative view of local government is that local people should look after
the interests of the local community which they were elected to serve,
maintaining and improving essential services at a price people can afford. That
is an honourable tradition of public service, still upheld by councillors in
most local authorities.
But the abuses of left-wing Labour councils have shocked the nation. The Labour
Party leadership pretends that this is a problem in only a few London boroughs.
The truth is that the far Left control town halls in many of our cities.
The extremists have gained power in these areas partly because too few
ratepayers have an interest in voting for responsible councillors pursuing
sensible policies. Many people benefit from local services yet make little or no
contribution towards them: this throws too heavy a burden on too few shoulders.
There is much else wrong with the present system of domestic rates. They seem
unfair and arbitrary. And companies are left with little protection against huge
rate rises levied by councils controlled by Labour, Liberals and Social
Democrats, which drive them out of business and destroy jobs.
We have acted to protect ratepayers' interests in a number of ways. The wasteful
and unnecessary tier of the GLC and metropolitan counties has been eliminated -
to the substantial benefit of ratepayers. Our rate-capping legislation so
bitterly opposed by the Labour, SDP and Liberal parties in Parliament has
protected ratepayers from huge rate increases. This year alone, twenty councils
will be rate-capped nineteen of them Labour and one controlled by the Liberals
and the SDP saving ratepayers several hundred million pounds.
We will now tackle the roots of the problem. We will reform local government
finance to strengthen local democracy and accountability.
Local electors must be able to decide the level of service they want and how
much they are prepared to pay for it.
We will legislate in the first Session of the new Parliament to abolish the
unfair domestic rating system and replace rates with a fairer Community Charge.
This will be a fixed rate charge for local services paid by those over the age
of 18, except the mentally ill and elderly people living in homes and hospitals.
The less-well-off and students will not have to pay the full charge but everyone
will be aware of the costs as well as the benefits of local services. This
should encourage people to take a greater interest in the policies of their
local council and in getting value for money. Business ratepayers will pay a
Unified Business Rate at a standard rate pegged to inflation.
We will require local authorities to put out to tender a range of services,
including refuse collection, the cleaning of streets and buildings, vehicle
maintenance, catering and ground maintenance.
Ratepayers expect councils to provide their services as efficiently as possible.
Yet some local authorities steadfastly oppose private sector companies tendering
for services even though they could provide them more cheaply and effectively.
The independent Audit Commission has estimated that some £500 million a year
could be saved if all councils followed the practices of the best sums which
could be used to lower rates or improve services.
The Widdicombe Report into the conduct of local authority business painted a
disturbing picture of the breakdown of democratic processes in a number of
councils. We will take action to strengthen democratic processes in local
authorities.
Inner Cities
The regeneration of the inner cities must be tackled. The growth in our national
prosperity in recent years has been founded on a rebirth of enterprise. But in
many of our inner cities the conditions for enterprise and pride of ownership
have been systematically extinguished by Socialist councils. For the sake of
those living in our inner cities we must remove the barriers against private
investment, jobs and prosperity which such councils have erected.
We are setting up five new Urban Development Corporations which will have the
powers, resources and management structure to reclaim and redevelop great tracts
of derelict land: these new Corporations will follow the model successfully
applied in London Docklands and on Merseyside.
Our Unified Business Rate will ensure that companies and jobs are not driven out
of inner city areas by the high rates of profligate councils.
We have roughly doubled the resources to reclaim derelict land. We will improve
procedures to accelerate the process of bringing vacant and under-used public
sector land back into productive use.
We will build on the experience of Urban Development Corporations by creating
new mini-UDCs. These will operate on a smaller scale in areas where there is
clear economic potential but where the local authorities are failing to tackle
the problem.
Our Urban Programme provides a range of grants to help industry and local
councils undertake projects that will improve the environment and encourage new
investment.
We are helping to lead local action through our five City Action Teams, sixteen
Inner City Task Forces and the Inner City Partnerships. All of them draw on
government assistance and work with local business and local people to promote
enterprise, employment and training.
Great cities are built on the enterprise and vitality of the individuals who
live there. Our aim is to create a climate which encourages and harnesses that
energy in the interests of all.
A BETTER SOCIETY
Planning and the Environment
Conservatives are by instinct conservationists - committed to preserve all that
is best of our country's past. We are determined to maintain our national
heritage of countryside and architecture. Since taking office we have:
  more than doubled the area of specially protected Green Belt: we will continue
  to defend it against unsuitable development;
  established new arrangements, backed with public funds, to make farming more
  sensitive to wildlife and to conservation;
  completed the work of listing pre-war buildings which receive legal protection
  and extended such protection to the best post-war buildings;
  established a new, powerful Pollution Inspectorate;
  passed new laws on the control of pesticides and implemented new controls on
  the pollution of water;
  put in hand plans for cleaning up Britain's beaches, costing over £300 million
  over the next four years;
  more than doubled spending after allowing for inflation on countryside and
  nature conservation since 1979;
  set in hand the establishment of the new Norfolk Broads Authority - a major
  environmental initiative;
  established a huge programme, costing over £4,000 million, to clean up the
  environment of the Mersey Basin by the early years of the next century.
We are determined to maintain the Green Belt. We will protect the countryside
for its own sake and conserve its wildlife, while allowing for those small scale
and well planned developments which are needed to provide jobs and keep country
areas thriving.
Wherever possible we want to encourage large-scale developments to take place on
unused and neglected land in our towns and cities rather than in the
countryside. We want to improve on our performance in 1986 when nearly half of
all new development took place on reused land.
A Practical Agenda
Only the Conservatives have a serious costed agenda for further environmental
action for another five years of Government. We will:
  continue our £600 million programme of modifying power stations, to combat
  acid rain;
  adopt improved standards, in concert with Europe, for reducing pollution from
  cars. We have already reduced tax on lead-free petrol and will encourage its
  wider use;
  introduce new laws on air pollution and dangerous wastes;
  double the funding for Environmentally Sensitive Areas;
  introduce new laws giving extra protection to the landscape of our National
  Parks;
  encourage more small woodlands in lowland areas through new grants;
  legislate to safeguard common land on the basis of the Common Land Forum, and
  continue to protect public access to the countryside through footpaths;
  support scientifically justified, international action to protect the
  atmosphere and the sea from damage from pollutants;
  establish a National Rivers Authority to take over responsibilities for
  ensuring strict safeguards against the pollution of rivers and water courses
  and to pursue sound conservation policies. The water supply and sewage
  functions of the water authorities will be transferred to the private sector;
  set up safe facilities for disposing of radioactive waste from power stations,
  hospitals and other sources: we have asked UK NIREX to come forward with
  proposals for deep disposal.
The Arts
Our international reputation in the arts has never been higher. Tourists flock
to this country to enjoy the highest standards of theatre, music, artistic
excellence and our museums. Art centres have nearly doubled in number since
1979. Attendances at theatres, concerts, cinemas and historic houses have all
risen significantly.
Under the Conservatives, spending on the arts has risen by 15 per cent since
1979 after allowing for inflation. Over the same period, the Arts Council grant
has risen from £61 million to nearly £139 million. And schemes like the Business
Sponsorship Incentive Scheme have pushed the value of such sponsorship from £72
million to £25 million over the last decade.
In future years:
  We will maintain government support for the arts and continue to encourage
  private support.
  We will make it a major objective to ensure that excellence in the arts is
  available in all parts of the country.
  We will continue to safeguard our heritage, particularly through the National
  Heritage Memorial Fund, created by this Government in 1980 to assist the
  preservation, maintenance and acquisition of items of outstanding merit which
  might otherwise be lost to the nation.
  We will encourage our great national museums and galleries to make the
  national treasures which they house more widely accessible.
Sport
We have increased funding for the Sports Council from £15 million in 1978/79 to
£37 million in 1987/88.
We will continue to work with the Council and, through our funding of the Sports
Council National Centres, we will encourage the pursuit of excellence in our
sports.
We want to encourage competitive sports through schools and clubs and we
strongly oppose any attempts to ban competitive sports in schools.
We will continue to encourage schools and colleges to open their facilities for
community use wherever possible to co-operate with other owners to achieve
public access to sport premises.
Football hooliganism has tarnished the good name of British sportsmanship. We
have acted to control the sale of alcohol at sports grounds. We have enhanced
police powers to stop and search at football grounds and we have encouraged
tougher sentencing of hooligans.
Broadcasting
Our objectives for broadcasting are to provide consumers with a wider range of
programmes, to encourage independent producers, and to preserve the high
standards which we have traditionally enjoyed in British broadcasting.
Vital decisions will need to be made in the next Parliament. We have already
published proposals for a less regulated and more diverse radio system. We shall
follow a policy of more competition, variety and innovation in our domestic
networks and encourage the export of British programmes to international
audiences and markets. The development of the broadcasting industry will be
allowed to occur, wherever possible, commercially.
We will therefore introduce a major new Broadcasting Bill in the new Parliament.
It will enable the broadcasters to take full advantage of the opportunities
presented by technological advances and to broaden the choice of viewing and
listening.
The broadcasters owe it to the lively talent in the independent sector to take
more programmes from them.
We will ensure that at least 25 per cent of programmes broadcast on both ITV and
BBC will be supplied by independent producers as soon as possible.
The responsibility for enforcing broadcasting standards must rest with the
broadcasting authorities. The present Broadcasting Complaints Commission has a
relatively narrow remit. But there is deep public concern over the display of
sex and violence on television. We will therefore bring forward proposals for
stronger and more effective arrangements to reflect that concern.
We will remove the current exemption enjoyed by broadcasters under the Obscene
Publications Act 1959.
BRITAIN AND THE WORLD
Britain is once again giving a lead in world affairs. We are forthright in
support of freedom and justice. We stand up vigorously for Britain's interests
abroad. Our voice is heard with respect on the crucial issues of war and peace,
of finance and trade.
Defending the Nation
The first duty of government is the defence of the realm and the preservation of
peace. Nuclear weapons are vital to that task. In the 40 years since 1945, more
than 10 million people have died in wars around the globe. But there has been
peace in Europe.
Conventional weapons did not succeed in deterring war. But nuclear weapons have
prevented, not only nuclear war, but conventional war in Europe as well. A
strong defence policy has proved to be the most effective peace policy.
Labour's policy is to give up Britain's independent nuclear deterrent without
asking anything in return. The Labour Party would require the United States to
withdraw its nuclear weapons from our soil and to close down NATO nuclear bases
in Britain. It would remove Britain altogether from the protection of the United
States' nuclear umbrella.
That policy would abandon the defence policy followed by every British
government, Labour or Conservative, since the Second World War. It would expose
us to nuclear blackmail from the vast Soviet armoury, to which we would have no
reply. It would inflict damage, perhaps fatal damage, on the Atlantic Alliance
on which we and Western Europe depend for our security. It would strike at our
relations with our most important ally, weakening the American commitment to
Europe's defences. It would, in short, be the biggest victory for the Soviet
Union in 40 years.
The defence policy of the Liberals and Social Democrats is muddled and confused.
They would cancel Trident and they have no clear idea of what to put in its
place. Their suggested replacements are much more expensive than Trident, which
costs only 3p in every £ of defence spending. None would be available in time.
None would provide equal security.
The Liberal and SDP defence policy would be one-sided disarmament by default or
inadvertence. The only difference between it and Labour policy is a matter of
timing. Labour would scrap Britain's deterrent immediately upon entering office.
The Liberals and Social Democrats would allow it to wither on the vine.
Only the Conservative Party stands by the defence policy which every post-war
government has seen to be necessary and which has kept the peace of Europe for
more than a generation. We are not prepared to take risks with Britain's
security:
  We will stand fully by our obligations to our European and American allies in
  NATO.
  We will retain our independent nuclear deterrent and modernise it with
  Trident. Because of improvements in Soviet defences we need the greater
  capability of Trident to retain the necessary deterrence which Polaris gives.
  No amount of money spent on conventional defence would ever buy us the same
  degree of deterrence.
  We will continue to increase the effectiveness of our conventional forces, to
  provide them with the most modern equipment and to obtain better value for
  money from the defence budget. We have already increased defence spending by
  more than 20 per cent in real terms since 1979 and restored the pay and
  conditions of our servicemen.
But we also want to see a world in which there are fewer nuclear weapons. That
is why Britain is at the forefront of arms control negotiations.
We strive with our allies to achieve balanced and verifiable agreements for:
  the elimination of medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe and preferably
  world-wide;
  agreed constraints on shorter-range missiles;
  a 50 per cent cut in strategic nuclear missiles;
  and a world-wide ban on chemical weapons.
Western strength and resolution are essential to achieve these aims. That is why
the Conservative Government deployed Cruise missiles. All the Opposition parties
- Labour, Liberals and SDP - voted against deployment in the House of Commons.
Yet it was the deployment of Cruise and Pershing missiles which brought the
Soviet Union back to the negotiating table. We can look forward to an agreement
this year which will, for the first time, reduce the numbers of nuclear weapons.

With the Conservatives Britain is also taking the lead in working towards
greater trust and confidence between East and West, and to encourage changes in
the East, where disillusion with totalitarian Socialism grows inexorably. The
Prime Minister's historic visit to Moscow was a major contribution to this. We
shall welcome any move by the Soviet Union towards respect for basic human
rights. But we must not lower our guard. Strong defence is still the surest
foundation for building peace.
Europe Grows in Strength
This Government has taken Britain from the sidelines into the mainstream of
Europe. But being good Europeans does not prevent us from standing up for
British interests. The agreement we negotiated on the Community Budget has saved
Britain £4,500 million since 1984.
We will continue to work for strict controls on the Community Budget.
Britain has led the way in establishing a genuine common market, with more trade
and services moving freely across national boundaries.
We will campaign for the opening of the market in financial and other services
and the extension of cheaper air fares in Europe.
We will also continue to work with our European partners to defend our own
trading interests and press for freer trade among all nations.
All of this will help safeguard existing jobs and create new ones.
We will continue to play a responsible leading role in the development of the
Community, while safeguarding our essential national interests.
Firm Against Terrorism and Aggression
Britain has stood at the forefront in the fight against international terrorism.
No democracy has a better record than Britain in standing up to the terrorists,
who threaten the most basic values of civilised life.
We will seek the support of other democratic nations for the provisions of the
European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.
We stood up to aggression in the Falklands and would do so again, if necessary.
We want normal relations with Argentina. We have made numerous proposals to that
end. But we stand by our pledges to the Islanders. We will not negotiate on the
sovereignty of the Falklands.
The Wider World
When other countries are prepared to act in good faith, the Conservative
Government has shown the will and the diplomatic skill to find solutions to
age-old conflicts and misunderstandings. Our record of tackling long-standing
problems in Hong Kong, Zimbabwe and Gibraltar demonstrates our determination to
seek peaceful and imaginative settlements of difficult international disputes.
We have played a prominent part in bringing Israel and the moderate Arab states
closer to peace negotiations in the framework of an international conference.
We believe that the issues of Southern Africa, too, will be tackled best by
dialogue, not violence. We want to see an end to apartheid in South Africa. But
trade and economic sanctions would only serve to entrench apartheid, increase
the risk of bloodshed and inflict severe hardship on black South Africans
without bringing a settlement any nearer. Negotiations between the leaders of
the South African people are the best way to resolve the problems of that
unhappy country.
Overseas Aid
We have the sixth largest aid programme in the western world, and the third
largest in Europe, spending about £1,300 million each year. Britain pioneered
the reform of Europe's food aid policy, to make it more rapid and effective. We
have substantially increased our support for the disaster, famine and refugee
relief activities of voluntary agencies, as well as for their long-term
development work. We have led the way in giving help to the people of Ethiopia,
ravaged by famine. Our ""Aid and Trade Provision"" funds have helped win good
development contracts for British firms worth over £2 billion since 1979.
We will maintain our substantial aid programme and direct it ever more
effectively.
We will bring more young people from Commonwealth and other countries to train
and study in Britain.
We ourselves have made positive and practical proposals for international action
to help some of the poorest and most indebted countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
Labour's proposal of selective import controls would damage developing
countries, open the door to protectionism and harm those poorest countries which
most need our help. It would also be bad for Britain. The best contribution
Britain can make to developing countries is to champion open trade and free
enterprise abroad and to practise them at home.
A Fateful Choice
For decades there was basic agreement between political parties on defence and
foreign policy. That agreement was firmly in the national interest. It has been
torn up by our opponents.
Labour's policy would mean not a secure Britain, but a neutralist Britain. And
eventually for there can be no trifling with Soviet power a frightened and
fellow-travelling Britain.
The Liberals and Social Democrats would take us more slowly down that same
disastrous road.
This election matters more for our safety and freedom than any election since
the Second World War.
CONCLUSION: THE WAY FORWARD
The proposals outlined in this manifesto are the extension of policies which
have already proved outstandingly successful.
Today Britain is a stable and well-governed country which exercises great
influence in the world.
We seek the support of the British people to make this achievement truly secure,
to build upon it and to extend its benefits to all.
No previous government with eight years of office to its credit has ever
presented the electorate with such a full programme of radical reform.
No other party, presenting its manifesto proposals to the nation, has been able
to support them with such a solid record of achievement.
We commend them with confidence to the British people.

British Conservative Party election manifesto, 1992Conservative Party 1992
The Best Future for Britain



FOREWORD
At the end of this Parliament a new Millennium will be in view We must raise our
sights high. This Manifesto is about making our country respected and secure,
and helping you achieve a better; safer and more prosperous future. For I
believe - strongly - that you, and not the Government, should be in charge of
your life. That's what Conservatism stands for. That principle underlies all the
policies in this Manifesto.
I believe in a responsible society Government's duties are clear: to protect
Britain in a dangerous world; to look after those who cannot look after
themselves; to protect law-abiding people from crime and disorder; and to
protect the value of our currency - without which all spending pledges are
worthless and all savings at risk.
But I believe also in a society in which government doesn't try to take
responsibility away from people. Politicians must never make the mistake of
thinking the state always knows best, or that it is entitled to the lion's share
of people's money I believe in low taxes not just because they ignite enterprise
- the spark of economic growth - but because they put power and choice where it
belongs: in your hands.
So when you compare what the politicians are saying in this election, ask
yourself these questions. Whom do you trust to take responsibility for Britain's
defence; to keep us safe and strengthen our influence for good? And who, at the
same time, wants to give you the opportunity to do your best for yourself and
your family?
Who will give you the power to choose - to say for yourself what you want? And
who will give you the personal prosperity that comes from low taxes - from your
own savings, your own pension, your own home? Who will let you build up your own
stake in Britain's success - and pass it on to your children?
Only Conservatives can truly claim to be the party of opportunity; choice;
ownership and responsibility. Socialists like to keep people under the
government's thumb. Conservatives want to give them independence. But we also
want to put government at your service, giving you what you've paid for - good
public services, responsible to you.
I do not believe the answer to every problem is simply for government to dig
deeper in your pocket. I believe it often lies in changing the way government
works; in making it respond to you. Government should look outwards. It should
listen. It should put you in the know not keep you in the dark.
We have made quite a start, under the seal of the Citizen's Charter People in
schools, hospitals, public offices of all kinds are rising to the challenge. I
knew they would. They just needed encouragement, incentive and a system that is
outward-looking too.
It is all part of a revolution in quality in Britain. British goods are once
more winning in the toughest markets abroad. There is new vigour in the
businesses liberated from state ownership; better management and better
industrial relations. These are the firm foundations of economic recovery
We are raising the quality of our education and training. We are raising the
standard of our housing, as more people own and improve their own homes. We are
concerned for the quality of our environment. And in government, we are leading
a drive for quality throughout our public services.
That, I believe, is the way we all want to live - a decent life in a civilised
community. That is the way we can live: celebrating our achievements, not
nurturing old grudges; enjoying our successes, not talking Britain down. We can
be free of old prejudices and class bafflers. We can encourage diversity, not
division; achievement, not antagonism. We can all make our own contribution to
the success of the United Kingdom; and we must keep that kingdom united.
You know I believe in choice. And in this election, as always, there is another
choice. You can vote for our opponents, and watch them take Britain back to the
1970s. Back to socialism. Back to strikes. Back to strife. Back to the world's
pity, or worse still, contempt. I don't believe Britain wants that. I know the
world doesn't want that for Britain.
I hope you will choose a different path - to go forward, not back; to go for the
best, knowing that Britain can be the best and do it best. My belief is clean
Only the best is good enough for Britain.
John Major

YOUR CHOICE AT THIS ELECTION



TAKING RESPONSIBILITY FOR BRITAIN
The world has been transformed in recent years. Communism has collapsed in
Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union has fallen apart. Everywhere Socialism is
in retreat and democracy, human rights and market economics are advancing. The
authority of the UN has been bolstered and Iraqi aggression seen off. Talks are
under way in the Middle East and South Africa. It is a time of great
opportunity, but also of new dangers.
Britain needs firm leadership at this time. We must be represented by a team of
quality and experience. A team which can help shape the world for the next
century A Conservative team.
Under the Conservatives, Britain has regained her rightful influence in the
world. We have stood up for the values our country has always represented. We
have defended Britain's interests with vigour and with success.
The respect with which Britain is regarded in the world has rarely been higher.
We play a central part in world affairs as a member of the European Community,
NATO, the Commonwealth and the Group of 7 leading industrial countries, and as a
Permanent Member of the UN Security Council. No other country holds all these
positions.
We are taking a leading role in recasting all the main international
institutions to which we belong: the United Nations, the European Community,
NATO, and the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister convened the first ever meeting
of the UN Security Council at Heads of Government level. Between now and the end
of 1992 there will be seven Summits where issues of critical importance to our
future will be determined: two EC Councils, at Lisbon and Edinburgh, the G7
Summit, the CSCE Summit, EC Summits with the US and Japan, and the Earth Summit
at Rio de Janeiro. Britain will be at the centre of these negotiations.
THE NEED FOR LEADERSHIP
The end of the Cold War has enabled the UN to act with new unity and authority
Under the authority of the UN, British forces played a leading and courageous
part in the Gulf War and the liberation of Kuwait. At the Prime Minister's
instigation, the UN also backed the operation to protect the Kurds.
Britain has led the world in helping the reforms in the former Soviet Union. The
Prime Minister gave full and immediate support to President Yeltsin in the
August coup attempt, and was the first Western leader to visit Moscow after the
coup failed. Britain has led the way in building up relations with the republics
of the new Commonwealth of Independent States. We have provided valuable
economic and humanitarian aid to ease the transition to a market economy
  We will support an enhanced role for the UN in peace-keeping and combating
  state-sponsored terrorism.
  We are determined that Iraq should comply with the terms of the Guff War
  cease-fire agreement, and in particular that it should co-operate with the UN
  in dismantling its weapons of mass destruction.
  We support early Russian membership of the IMF and World Bank, as well as a
  stabilisation fund for the rouble.
  We are co-operating with our partners to provide urgent help to the former
  Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to upgrade the safety of their nuclear power
  stations.
  We strongly support the peace process in the Middle East. The outcome of the
  talks must safeguard the security of Israel and achieve self-determination for
  the people of the occupied territories.
  We will safeguard the prosperity of Hong Kong, nurture democratic institutions
  and work with the Chinese Government within the terms of the Joint
  Declaration.
  We seek a solution to the dispute which has divided Cyprus since 1974. A
  settlement must recognise that Cyprus is indivisible and that the rights of
  both communities must be assured. We will support the UN's efforts to secure a
  fair and lasting solution.
  The problems of Kashmir cannot be resolved by violence. We urge both India and
  Pakistan to address and resolve the issue, and we stand ready to help.
OUR INFLUENCE FOR GOOD
All over the world countries are turning to democracy and free markets. Last
October in Harare, the Commonwealth took on a new role as a promoter of
democracy the rule of law, and respect for individual freedoms. Already the
Commonwealth is monitoring elections to ensure that they are free and fair.
Britain is taking the lead in encouraging these trends.
We give substantial aid to the relief of poverty and to help the struggling
economies of the developing world. Our aid programme next year (excluding aid to
Eastern Europe and the CIS) will reach £1,800 million. Britain also makes more
direct private investment in the developing world than any other EC country -
some £2,400 million in 1989. We are urging the international community to take
decisive action on debt relief, the liberalisation of world trade and support
for good government.
We continue to accept the long term UN target for aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP,
although we cannot set a timetable for its achievement. The quality of Britain's
overseas aid programme is second to none. It is well targeted and highly
effective. Eighty per cent of our bilateral aid goes to the poorest countries.
New aid to the poorest is given as grants, not loans.
We are supporting projects designed to build efficient institutions and
accountable government. We are helping to improve public administration and the
legal system in a number of countries.
The English language is one of our nation's greatest assets - culturally
politically and commercially The BBC World Service has unrivalled standing
around the globe. The British Council acts as a cultural ambassador for Britain
and for the English language.
  We will use overseas aid to promote good government, sensible economic
  policies, the rooting out of corruption, and - crucially - respect for human
  rights and the rule of law.
  We will press creditor countries to accept the Prime Minister's proposal - the
  'Trinidad Terms' - for a two-thirds reduction in the official debt of the
  poorest countries.
  We will promote the development of multi- party systems through the new
  Westminster Foundation for Democracy.
  We will promote the English language by strengthening both the British Council
  and the BBC World Service. We will encourage both to become more
  entrepreneurial in order to finance their activities in developing markets.
THE RISKS WE FACE NOW
The collapse of the old Soviet Union has dramatically vindicated Conservative
defence policy. We have always put the security of our country first. We have
kept the peace by staying strong.
Today the threat of a massive surprise attack from Eastern Europe has gone. But
we still face grave risks to our security. We cannot drop our guard. Under the
Conservatives, Britain will never do so.
Within the former Soviet Union there remains a huge military force. Democracy
and the rule of law are yet to be firmly established. Control over these armed
forces and the massive nuclear capability is uncertain. The events in Yugoslavia
show what can happen when Communism collapses in disorder.
Increasingly threats come from outside Europe - as we saw so clearly in the
Gulf. Many more countries are acquiring large stocks of modern arms. Some are
trying to obtain nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. Britain must be able
to respond to any unexpected danger.
The Conservatives are the only party who recognise both the opportunities and
the threats of the new world.
For over forty years, our security has been based firmly on NATO, the most
successful defensive alliance ever. We will work with our allies to ensure that
NATO remains the cornerstone of our defence. Britain will command a new NATO
Rapid Reaction Corps ready to deploy quickly to counter any sudden threat. As
Europeans we must accept a greater role in safeguarding the peace in our
continent.
We will promote arms control and reduction initiatives. On Britain's initiative,
the UN is establishing a register of arms transfers in order to monitor any
dangerous arsenals of weapons.
Britain has always been strongly opposed to nuclear proliferation. We will back
an enhanced role for the International Atomic Energy Agency in inspecting
nuclear sites and for the UN Security Council in acting against those nations
which break their non proliferation obligations.
  We will work to strengthen the Western European Union as the European pillar
  of NATO. We will press for a European reaction force.
  We will intensify the co-ordination of security policies within the Twelve.
  We will work through the CSCE to safeguard the security of Europe.
  We will support a comprehensive and verifiable ban on chemical weapons, and
  further controls on the export of items which could be used in making
  biological weapons.
  We will help Russia in her efforts to dismantle nuclear weapons.
OUR ARMED FORCES
Only the Conservatives can be trusted to maintain the quality and capability of
our Armed Forces. We are proud of the skill, courage and professionalism which
they displayed in the Gulf and which they show daily in Northern Ireland.
We are the only party unambiguously committed to the preservation and
modernisation of our independent nuclear deterrent.
Our defence would be unsafe in the hands of the opposition parties. Labour have
opposed our defence policies at every turn. They have twisted and turned in
their attitude to our nuclear deterrent. They would devastate our conventional
forces by cuts of at least 27 per cent, which would lead to huge job losses in
the defence industries.
The Liberal Democrats would cause even more damage to Britain's defences. Their
aim is to cut our defence spending by half by the end of the decade.
We insist that our forces have the modern, effective equipment that they need.
The Gulf War showed that the Services must have the latest technology to give
them maximum flexibility and mobility. That is why we have ordered the new
Challenger II tank for the Army, the Merlin helicopter for the Navy, the ASRAAM
air defence missile for the RAF and a wide range of other new equipment for our
Forces.
Our reappraisal of Britain's defence needs will result an a major restructuring
of our Armed Forces to take account of the changing world situation. In future
our Forces will be smaller, but better equipped. Our Services deserve the
excellent pay and conditions which we have secured for them and will maintain.
  We will complete the deployment of the next generation of Britain's minimum
  nuclear deterrent. We will order and complete the fourth Trident submarine.
  We will ensure the Forces have the best and most modern equipment.
  We will improve the quality and management of service housing and help those
  in the Forces save towards buying a home of their own.
  The Reserves will play an even more important role and we will introduce
  legislation to allow their more flexible use.
THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
The Conservatives have been the party of Britain in Europe for 30 years. We have
argued when argument was necessary; but we have not wavered nor changed our
views. We have ensured that Britain is at the heart of Europe; a strong and
respected partner.
We have played a decisive part in the development of the Community over the past
decade. It was a British initiative which launched the Single Market programme
and our insistence which reformed the Community's finances. Britain has promoted
co-operation on foreign policy and in combating terrorism. Britain has also
persuaded our partners to welcome new countries who apply for Community
membership.
The Maastricht Treaty was a success both for Britain and for the rest of Europe.
British proposals helped to shape the key provisions of the Treaty including
those strengthening the enforcement of Community law defence, subsidiarity and
law and order. But Britain refused to accept the damaging Social Chapter
proposed by other Europeans, and it was excluded from the Maastricht treaty
All Member States must live up to their obligations under Community law. At
Maastricht, we secured agreement that the European Court will be able to fine
any Member State which fails to do so.
  We will work closely with our partners in foreign policy and in the war on
  international crime.
  We will continue to resist changes to the Treaty of Rome that would damage
  British business.
  We will resist Commission initiatives which run counter to the principle that
  issues should be dealt with on a national basis wherever possible.
  Britain is a great trading nation. We prosper through the maintenance of an
  open trading system. We will work for a successful outcome to the GATT
  negotiations.
  We will redouble our efforts to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and will
  stoutly defend the interests of British farmers and consumers.
  We will insist on more effective control over Community spending and will
  resist pressure to extend Community competence to new areas.
  We will work to strengthen the external frontiers of the Community whilst
  maintaining the checks needed at our own borders against illegal immigration,
  drugs, terrorism and disease.
THE BRITISH PRESIDENCY
In the second half of 1992 Britain will take the Chair of the Council of
Ministers. The British Presidency comes at a turning point in the Community's
history. It gives us the opportunity to shape the direction of the Community and
to establish its priorities. We shall use it to promote our vision of an outward
looking Community based on free enterprise.
Our Presidency will reach its climax at the Edinburgh meeting of the European
Council, which we will hold in the historic palace of Holyrood House. While the
attention of Europe is focused on Edinburgh, the strength of our Union will be
visible to all.
Our priorities will be:
  To start negotiations with those EFTA countries who want to join the Community
  so that they can join by 1995.
  To build on the EC's Association Agreements with Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
  Poland so that we can welcome them to full membership by the year 2000.
  To conclude EC trade and co-operation agreements with the main republics of
  the former Soviet Union.
  To complete the single market and extend it to the seven countries of EFTA-
  Over half our trade is with the rest of the Community. The single market will
  create an open market of 350 million customers for British goods and services.
  To complete the single market we shall aim to:
    open up the market for life insurance to free competition;
    liberalise air travel to bring down air fares in Europe closer to those in
    America;
    free up the shipping and road transport markets so that British operators
    can carry freely within the EC;
    increase competition in the European energy sector.
  We will provide guidance and help to any British company encountering a trade
  barrier illegal under European law.
  We will press for progress on the environment, including the Fifth Environment
  Action Programme.
  We will chair the negotiations on the future spending priorities of the
  Community to ensure value for money. We will safeguard the abatement
  negotiated by Mrs Thatcher which has so far brought some £12,000 million in
  budget rebates to Britain.
WEALTH AND OWNERSHIP
The 1990s present a great economic opportunity for Britain. We have got the
scourge of inflation under control. We have cut direct tax rates. And a stable
currency gives industry a chance to realise the potential released by the
reforms of the 1980s.
We have extended ownership more widely - of homes, savings and shares - with
millions more sharing directly in Britain's success. We will promote enterprise
through low taxes, sound money and a stable currency.
When the Exchange Rate Mechanism was being created, during the final days of the
last Labour Government, the then Prime Minister decided Britain could not take
part.
It was easy to see why The economy was too weak. Inflation was too high. In
1974-79, the inflation rate averaged over 15 per cent. It peaked at 27 per cent.
Public borrowing rose to nearly 10 per cent of national income - equivalent to
£55,000 million today Penal taxes blunted enterprise. Britain was a byword for
strikes.
The Conservatives have changed all that. Since 1979, our inflation rate has
averaged 7½ per cent. Now it is only just over 4 per cent - below the average
for the European Community In the 1960s and 1970s, Britain had the slowest
growth rate in the European Community. But in the 1980s, we grew faster than
either France or Germany Industrial disputes became rare events. And in 1990, a
Conservative Government joined the ERM.
Penal taxes have been abolished. A man on average earnings, with a wife and two
children, has an income today which after tax and inflation is 39 per cent
higher than it was in Labour's last year. That great advance in the standard of
living is at risk in this election.
Since the war, living standards have always risen faster under Conservative
Governments than under Labour. Now we are pledged to cut tax rates again - and
have made a start on the road to 20p Income Tax.
Corporate tax rates have been cut, too. Our business investment has increased
more rapidly than in any other major economy except Japan. Britain attracts by
far the biggest share of Japanese and American investment in Europe. That, too,
is at risk in this election.
BRITAIN'S OPPORTUNITY
We are now members of:
  The biggest free market in the world. British industry is again respected in
  Europe.
  A zone of low inflation, in which we can compete with the best.
Britain must not throw this opportunity away by electing a Labour government.
The world recession has been tough for all of us, at home and abroad.
Unemployment has risen. But in Britain we have laid the foundations for recovery
What is needed to trigger confidence and growth is a Conservative victory with a
decisive majority. What would postpone recovery, and turn this promise of growth
into the certainty of hard times, is the election of our opponents whose
policies would mean higher taxes, higher inflation, higher interest rates, more
bureaucratic regulation and more strikes.
In the 1990s, the Government's task will be to provide an economic environment
which encourages enterprise - the mainspring of prosperity. Our aims must be:
  To achieve price stability.
  To keep firm control over public spending.
  To continue to reduce taxes as fast as we prudently can.
  To make sure that market mechanisms and incentives are allowed to do their
  job.
Price stability does not mean a frozen economy in which no price ever moves. But
we must drive inflation down so low that it no longer affects the decisions made
by ordinary people, businesses and government.
When inflation rises, so do bankruptcies. When inflation falls, industry can
plan again for a profitable future. Inflation creates strife, as different
groups in society struggle to restore their living standards. It destroys jobs.
It erodes savings and social benefits and threatens our currency.
INFLATION AND EUROPE
Membership of the ERM is now central to our counter-inflation discipline. But
the ERM is not a magic wand. It would not protect Labour; it would merely expose
the folly of Labour policies. Some Labour politicians know that all too well -
others simply don't. They - and some of the unions - would put irresistible
spending pressure on a Labour government.
Some members of the European Community are anxious to hurry on from the ERM to
Economic and Monetary Union. Others have doubts. Quite apart from the
constitutional issues, they do not want to take risks with what is being
achieved in the ERM.
The Treaty negotiated at Maastricht laid down the process under which the
Community can, if its members meet certain economic conditions, create a
monetary union with a single currency for some or all of them. Together with
Germany we fought for tough criteria. We believe a monetary union would
collapse, with damaging consequences, if it were imposed on economies that were
too diverse.
A union will only come about by 1997 if a substantial majority of Community
members agree it should. It would only include those members who were judged to
have met specified conditions. And it would only come about if a majority of
members were judged to have done so.
But the Treaty goes on to say that monetary union will come about automatically
in 1999, for all who meet the conditions. We did not want to exclude ourselves
from membership; but we could not accept such an automatic commitment. By the
end of this decade the EC's membership will have changed; the economic
performance of man of its members may have changed. We cannot tell who the
members of such a union might be.
We therefore secured the freedom to make a proper judgement on events. We are as
free to join if we wish as an other member. We would have to meet the same
conditions - no more, no less. We will play our full part in the discussions of
the monetary institutions Europe may create in the 1990s. But we are not obliged
to join in a single currency if we do not want to.
  In due course, we will move to the narrow bands of the ERM.
  We will play our full part in the design and discussion of monetary
  institutions for Europe.
  When or if other members of the EC move to a monetary union with a single
  currency, we will take our own unfettered decision on whether to join. That
  decision will be taken by the United Kingdom Parliament.
THE ROUTE TO LOWER TAXES
Economic growth is created by people's hard work, ingenuity thrift and
willingness to take risks. An enterprise economy rewards the industrious and
thrifty We believe that government should not gobble up all the proceeds of
growth, and that those who create prosperity should enjoy it, through lower
taxes and more opportunity to build up personal wealth.
Our policy is therefore to reduce the share of national income taken by the
public sector. In the mid-1970s, public spending peaked at over 49 per cent of
our gross national product. In the early 1980s, it peaked at over 47 per cent.
In this recession, it is peaking at only 43 per cent. We aim to reduce this
steadily as the recovery gets under way
Keeping control of public spending will enable us to cut taxes while bringing
the Government's Budget back towards balance in the years ahead. Excessive
government borrowing can lead to inflation. Government should always be on guard
against that danger. However, when demand in the economy is weak, public
borrowing will tend to rise.
Because companies pay taxes according to how well they did the previous year,
the deficit tends to be deepest just as we come out of recession. We must make
sure that as the economy grows, borrowing slows.
By bringing tax and spending decisions together in a unified Budget from next
year, we will make the choices clearer. But lower taxes and a prudent approach
to borrowing do not mean public spending must fall; quite the reverse. A
lightly-taxed economy generates more economic growth, and more revenue. High
taxes kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. In the course of its last five
years in office, Labour was forced to cut public spending, in real terms. By
contrast, the Conservatives have been able to raise public spending by nearly a
quarter in real terms.
Higher tax rates do not always bring in more money In practice, they can bring
in less. The Conservative Government has more than halved the top rate of tax.
Yet top rate taxpayers today provide a bigger share of our tax revenues than
they did before. Lower taxes have encouraged more people to work harder - not to
spend their time working out how to avoid penal taxes.
During the past 13 years we have cut, simplified or abolished a whole range of
direct taxes.
  We have cut the basic rate of Income Tax from 33p to 25p, and the top rate
  from 83p to 40p.
  We have now announced a new starting Income Tax rate of 20p.
  We have raised the basic single person's tax allowance by 27 per cent more
  than would be needed to keep pace with inflation.
  We have simplified and reduced the burden of taxation on capital.
  We have cut Corporation Tax from 52 per cent to 33 per cent (and from 42 per
  cent to 25 per cent for small companies).
  We have reduced the burden of National Insurance on low earners.
  We have introduced independent taxation of husbands and wives, giving married
  women full eligibility for tax allowances.
  We have introduced new tax incentives for savings.
  We have abolished several taxes completely including the surcharge on income
  from savings, the National Insurance Surcharge, Development Land Tax, and
  Capital Transfer Tax.
We are the only party that understands the need for low taxation. Labour and the
Liberals openly advocate increased taxation. Yet lower taxes clearly create a
more productive economy They also achieve another prime objective of
Conservative Governments, which is to transfer power from the state to the
people.
Labour would:
  Reverse our cut in the starting rate of Income Tax to 20p.
  Raise the top rate.
  Abolish the National Insurance ceiling.
  Introduce a new savings surcharge.
  We announced in the Budget an important first step towards a basic Income Tax
  rate of 20p. By applying a 20p rate to the first £2,000 of taxable income, we
  have cut taxes for all 25 million taxpayers, and taken the four million on
  lowest incomes out of 25p tax altogether.
  We will make further progress towards a basic Income Tax rate of 20p.
  We will reduce the share of national income taken by the public sector. We
  will see the budget return towards balance as the economy recovers.
THE RIGHT TO OWN
Since 1979, wealth has been spread more widely through the community Home
ownership, share ownership and the build-up of personal pensions have all
contributed. Over two-thirds of people live in homes that they own, 10 million
people own shares, 6 million of them in newly-privatised industries. About 2.5
million have benefited from tax incentives to encourage employee share schemes.
And over 4½ million people are now building up their own personal pensions.
But these freedoms are at risk.
Labour would:
  Halt the privatisation programme and threaten the value of shares in
  privatised industries with renationalisation and new Government controls.
  Bring back credit rationing, leading to mortgage queues.
  Turn the pensions market on its head, making pension provision costly and
  difficult.
These changes would drive savings overseas and make wealth again the prerogative
of the few.
By contrast, we want to do more to encourage the wider distribution of wealth
throughout society Sustaining not just a home-owning but a capital owning
democracy is crucial to our vision for the 1990s. We intend to spread the
ownership of shares, homes, pensions and savings. We will do so through future
privatisations, help for would-be home owners in council tenancies and further
encouragement for the spread of personal pensions. We intend to lighten the
burden of capital taxes and reform the taxation of savings.
We believe Inheritance Tax is particularly inequitable. It falls only on those
who do not dispose of their assets seven years or more before their death. It is
inevitably the case that these tend to be people who are not rich enough to
engage in high-powered tax planning, or who, for lack of knowledge or advice,
fail to take the necessary precautionary action. In the Budget, we announced
that we would take most family businesses out of Inheritance Tax altogether.
During the new Parliament, we will aim to lessen the burden on families to whom
home ownership has brought the threat of this erratic tax.
  As detailed later in this Manifesto, we will aim to bring home ownership,
  share ownership and personal pensions within the reach of more families.
  We will continue to reform the taxation of savings, building on the success of
  PEPs and TESSAs.
  We will raise the tax threshold for Inheritance Tax so that the homes and
  savings of an increasing number of our citizens can pass unencumbered from one
  generation to another.
  Whenever possible, we will ensure that future privatisations offer
  opportunities to employees to secure a stake in the ownership of their
  business.
  We will encourage companies to make dealing in their own shares easier,
  especially for small shareholders, and encourage wider share ownership,
  through, for example, the establishment of 'Share Shops'.
  We will abolish Stamp Duty on share transactions.
SETTING THE ECONOMY FREE
Starting with the abolition of exchange controls in 1979, the Government has
created new incentives for every part of our economy.
Manufacturing industry suffered particularly badly from the harm inflicted on
the British economy by Labour Governments in the 1960s and 1970s. To a far
greater extent than service industries, it was the victim of militant trades
unionism, restrictive practices, nationalisation, state intervention, tax
distortion, planning controls and over-regulation.
We believe strongly that a vigorous manufacturing sector is essential to a
healthy British economy Over the past 13 years, we have steadily dismantled
barriers to its growth.
The competitiveness and performance of British manufacturing have been
transformed. Its impressive recovery was recognised by the Confederation of
British Industry, in its report aptly titled Competing with the World's Best'.
Manufacturing productivity has risen by more than half since 1979 - faster than
in any other major industrial country. Over the past 10 years, British
manufactured exports have grown faster than those of France, Germany the United
States or even Japan.
The British motor industry has achieved an astonishing revival. By 1996, Britain
should again be exporting more cars than we import - for the first time since
1974. We have given the industry yet more encouragement in the Budget, by
halving the special tax paid on new cars.
The British Standard for Quality management has effectively become the
international standard. But that is only the beginning. We have set up a team of
senior business people to pursue the idea of a new British Quality Award.
The City is Europe's greatest financial centre. It contributes £11,000 million
net to our balance of payments. Financial services employ 12 per cent of our
workforce. London's capital markets and financial services have grown vigorously
because they are innovative and highly competitive. We will continue our efforts
to break down the barriers that prevent them from competing freely throughout
Europe and in the wider world.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is now based in London. It
puts us in the forefront of encouraging investment in the developing markets of
Central and Eastern Europe.
Service industries make a vital contribution to our economy and to our balance
of payments. Tourism, for example, today employs 1.5 million people, 20% more
than in 1980. It is an industry which boasts many famous companies - but it is
also driven by the dynamism of many small firms. We will continue to help them
by simplifying rules and regulations on business and through the DTI Enterprise
Initiative and a range of other schemes.
  We will continue to reduce tax burdens on business, as we have done this year
  for the motor industry, whenever it is possible to do so.
  We will abolish unnecessary licences and reduce the need for specific
  approvals for product design.
  We will back British companies encountering any discrimination, trade barriers
  or state subsidies that should no longer exist within the Single Market.
  We will back the regulators of the financial services industry in their
  efforts to achieve high standards while keeping the rule books down to
  manageable size.
PRIVATISATION
Competition and private ownership are the most powerful engines of economic
efficiency, innovation and choice. They lead to the creation of world-class
companies.
We have returned to private enterprise two-thirds of the companies once owned by
the state: 46 businesses employing about 900,000 people. This programme has been
the model for governments across the whole world.
The work of liberalising markets which were once monopolised goes on. In 1984 we
privatised British Telecom but only Mercury was given a licence to carry
services over fixed links. In 1991 we decided to end this duopoly The UK now has
one of the most open and dynamic telecommunications markets in the world.
But much greater economic efficiency is not the only gain. Employees have been
able to take a direct stake in the newly privatised companies. Millions of
people have been given the same chance to own a real share in the nation's
assets. Companies which looked inwards to Whitehall are now listening to their
customers and shareholders.
Some activities of government must always be provided in the public sector. But
in central government, Next Steps Agencies and local government, management is
increasingly buying-in services from the private sector. Our proposals for
developing this policy have been set out in the White Papers on 'Competing for
Quality' in central and local government.
  We will continue our privatisation programme. British Coal will be returned to
  the private sector. So will local authority bus companies. We will encourage
  local authorities to sell their airports. We will end British Rail's monopoly.
  We will sell certain rail services and franchise others. These proposals are
  set out later in this Manifesto.
  The Ports Act 1991 has paved the way for the privatisation of the Trust Ports
  by competitive tender. Tees and Hartlepool, Tilbury, Medway, Forth and Clyde
  have already been privatised.
  We are privatising Northern Ireland Electricity and will privatise the
  Northern Ireland water and sewage services. We will look for ways of bringing
  private sector skills into the management of Northern Ireland Railways.
  We will bring private sector enterprise into the public services by
  encouraging contracting out and competitive tendering throughout government.
  We will require all government departments to report annually on their plans
  for market-testing, and progress in achieving it, in their own services and in
  those of their associated agencies.
  We will maintain our programme of compulsory competitive tendering of local
  authority services. We will ensure that unfair terms are excluded and will
  discourage investment to protect in- house services when better, more cost
  effective services are available through the private sector.
  We will ensure that competitive tendering is extended to white collar local
  authority services, such as those offered by lawyers, accountants, architects
  and surveyors.
  We will tackle all anti-competitive and restrictive practices with vigour. We
  will introduce new legislation giving stronger powers to deal with cartels.
DEREGULATION
We are concerned that at every level of government - in Europe, in Whitehall and
in local authorities - some regulations may have been adopted in answer to
legitimate concerns, but without proper regard to their overall impact on
businesses and individuals. A proper balance needs to be struck between
essential protection for the public, and over-zealous and intrusive controls
aimed at the elimination of all conceivable risk. It is wrong that new
regulations, designed to deal with isolated problems, should interfere with the
private arrangements of citizens or with reasonable commercial practices that
have earned broad public acceptance.
  The compliance costs of new UK and EC regulations must be assessed properly.
  Existing regulations which are outmoded and burdensome must be simplified or
  removed. We will give priority to the work of the DTI Deregulation Unit in
  these areas.
  We will examine ways in which the uniform scope of regulation could be eased
  to safeguard traditional local products or practices.
  We will examine whether certain regulations affecting individual citizens
  within their own homes could be made advisory, rather than mandatory.
ENERGY
Our energy policies have brought the consumer both lower prices and better
service. We have privatised British Gas and the electricity industry in a way
that has opened these markets to competition. These policies are now being
seized upon in Europe as essential extensions of the Single Market.
Domestic customers are now protected by a price formula, and high standards of
service are enforced by the independent regulators. For instance, electricity
disconnections for debt have fallen by 43 per cent since the launch of
privatisation.
We have ensured that the safety of employees comes first, and have given
thousands the opportunity of acquiring a stake in their industry.
The future of the coal industry depends crucially on the competitiveness of coal
as a fuel for electricity generation. British Coal has made enormous progress in
increasing productivity since the end of the 1985 strike - but there is still
further to go. We will support the efforts of British Coal and its workforce to
improve the industry's performance. The long term future of the industry lies in
the private sector.
We have invested in clean coal technology to safeguard the environment.
Renewable energy projects have received unprecedented support. North Sea oil and
gas are enjoying a record expansion thanks to our policies of deregulation and
low taxation.
  Safety will remain our highest priority throughout the energy sector.
  We will continue to encourage competition in energy markets. We will
  progressively reduce British Gas' monopoly of the retail gas market, to give
  small users the same rights as big firms.
  We will privatise British Coal in a way that enables employees to enjoy a
  stake in the industry.
  We will increase our support for British Coal Enterprise which promotes
  economic regeneration in areas affected by the closure of mines, and has
  successfully assisted 76,000 people in finding new jobs.
  We will review the future of the nuclear industry in 1994. We are committed to
  safe and economical nuclear power. The existing strict arrangements for
  nuclear waste will be maintained.
  We will maintain a guaranteed market for renewable energy projects and fluid
  research in this area.
  We will consult on new building regulations to improve energy use. Together
  with British Gas and some of the Regional Electricity Companies, we will
  establish an independent Energy Savings Trust to promote energy efficiency.
  Our grants scheme for low income households will receive record funding next
  year.
SCIENCE AND INNOVATION
British science has an unrivalled reputation for ground-breaking research. We
believe in investing in scientific research because it enriches the quality of
our lives and provides the feedstock of industrial innovation. The science
budget has grown by 24 per cent in real terms since 1978-9. Increasingly funding
will reflect the quality of the research output so that the best centres can
truly be world leaders.
The Government spends nearly £3,000 million a year on civil research and
development - at least as high a proportion of national income as the Japanese
or Americans. And since 1978, British industry's spending on R&D has increased
by 37 per cent in real terms.
  We will continue to support our science base to maintain the excellence of our
  science and to ensure that we produce the skilled technical people we need.
  We will encourage the transfer of people and technology from universities to
  businesses and upgrade the LINK scheme, which funds joint research.
  We will encourage the establishment of centres of technological excellence
  linking industrial research organisations with universities and polytechnics.
  We will continue to develop new innovation schemes for small and medium-sized
  businesses, including the highly-regarded SPUR programme to provide help with
  the development of new products and processes.
REGIONAL POLICIES
In recent years, the United Kingdom has attracted five times as much Japanese
investment as Germany or France, which powerfully demonstrates that we have
created the most attractive environment in Europe for investors. Our positive
policy towards inward investment will be maintained, in contrast to that of the
TUC and the Labour Party.
The Government will continue to invest in a strong infrastructure, and boost
technology expertise in the regions.
  We will ensure that regional policy is well targeted.
  We will continue to support all parts of the United Kingdom in their campaigns
  to attract inward investment.
  We will give additional emphasis to upgrading skills and technology when
  allocating funds.
SMALL BUSINESSES
Small businesses are the seedcorn of the economy Their numbers have grown by
more than a third since 1979, while the number of self-employed people has grown
to over 12 per cent of the workforce. We will continue to recognise the special
needs of small and medium-sized companies, and to ensure that Government
delivers useful services to them.
Our tax regime for small businesses is one of the most favourable in Europe. We
have raised the VAT threshold every year since 1979 and reduced the small
companies rate of Corporation Tax from 42 per cent to 25 per cent.
Training and Enterprise Councils (and Local Enterprise Companies in Scotland)
have developed a wide range of services for business and enterprise which assist
over 150,000 small companies each year. We have developed the popular Enterprise
Initiative, under which 40,000 companies have been helped to buy in outside
expertise offering key management skills. We now propose to develop this
initiative further.
We also propose to help businesses by easing the transfer of commercial
tenancies.
  We announced in the Budget new measures to help small businesses, including
  full relief against Inheritance Tax on most business assets, reductions in
  business rates and proposals to speed up the payment of outstanding bills.
  During the new Parliament, we will develop a new Enterprise Service to give
  small and medium-sized companies help in diagnosing their most important
  strategic needs. A new Consultancy Brokerage Service will supply information
  to small companies. We will also develop a Technology Audit which will provide
  small firms with a plan for change. And we will continue to support Total
  Quality Management consultancies.
  TECs and LECs will be closely involved in developing and implementing this new
  initiative.
The independent Law Commission has recommended that a commercial tenant should
in general be freed from any future liability under a lease when he assigns away
his interest under it. We will consider how this principle could be put into
effect for new commercial leases.
CONSUMER AFFAIRS
Consumers want choice, quality and value for money Competition only works
effectively if consumers have the information they need to make sensible
decisions.
Our food safety policy promotes consumer choice and consumer safety We
introduced the 1990 Food Safety Act to ensure the highest standards of food
hygiene.
  We will introduce legislation designed to give consumers confidence that what
  they purchase is properly described - and that adequate compensation is
  offered where these requirements are not met.
  We will enable the courts to override unfair terms in contracts and improve
  our powers to deal with rogue traders.
  We will ensure that guarantees mean what they say, and that manufacturers or
  importers share responsibility with the people who sell their goods.
  We will tighten up the rules on holiday brochures and contracts, and introduce
  a 'cooling-off' period into timeshare contracts.
  We will introduce legislation to simplify trade mark registration and extend
  the rights they confer.
  We will enforce science-based controls on the use of chemicals in food
  production, and will maintain our policy of open access to information on
  pesticide safety.
  We will improve standards of food labelling in close consultation with
  consumer representatives.
CHOICE AND THE CHARTER
The Citizen's Charter is the most far-reaching programme ever devised to improve
quality in public services. It addresses the needs of those who use public
services, extends people's rights, requires services to set clear standards -
and to tell the public how far those standards are met.
The Citizen's Charter:
  widens popular choice;
  helps people to exercise that choice in a properly informed way;
  expects all public services to put the customer first;
  promotes the challenge of competition within the public sector;
  requires clear performance standards to be set and for services to be measured
  against them;
  insists on a proper response to complaints and on action to set right the
  problems behind them.
The Charter will be at the centre of government's decision-making throughout the
1990s. No one doubts the professionalism of the vast majority of public
servants. But too often the system's outdated working methods and attitudes
prevent them from giving their best. The Charter's commitment to modern, open
services will help them to win the respect that good service deserves.
In less than a year since the White Paper, 18 detailed Charters have been
published. Each sets out tough new standards and gives new information and
rights to the public. Each will be revised regularly to check on progress, and
raise standards higher. But, already results are clear.
  In hospitals, from April, every out-patient will have a fixed appointment time
  and our guarantee of maximum waiting times for operations will be steadily
  improved.
  On council estates every tenant will have the right to call in a private
  contractor if the council fails to do a minor repair.
  In schools, all parents will have the right to a report on their child's
  performance and details on that of the school.
Rights such as these should not have been denied to the public. The Citizen's
Charter, steadily but surely, is changing all that.
KNOWLEDGE, STANDARDS, CHOICE
The next Conservative Government will carry the Charter still further. There
will be more information about standards and performance; clear standards set
within public services which are still shrouded in mystery; more choice built
into public services and proper complaints procedures introduced. Many of these
are outlined later in the Manifesto under Education, Health, Local Government
and Transport. Here are a few examples from the programme for the next two
years:
  The Audit Commission will be able to publish league tables of performance
  including each local council and health authority so that people can compare
  the quality of service.
  We will ensure that inspection reports are published and widely available. All
  councils will have to respond in public to criticism from auditors.
  We will introduce a new 'Charterline' that people with questions or problems
  with a public service will be able to ring.
  We will require British Rail to tighten its targets for reliability and
  punctuality on all lines, and report monthly to passengers on how it is doing.
  London Underground will publish its own Charter.
  We will expect Post Offices and Job Centres to set out standards of service
  and levels of achievement.
  A new Charter Mark award will give recognition to those parts of the public
  service that best meet Charter standards.
  British Rail and London Underground are introducing compensation systems for
  travellers.
  We will review the powers of the Local Government Ombudsman to ensure that
  findings of maladministration are properly dealt with by all local
  authorities. We will consult on a new Lay Adjudicators scheme to help the
  public resolve difficulties and disputes.
We will extend competition and accountability in public services. Those who
provide public services will have to prove they can give the right quality at
the right cost.
  We will extend compulsory competitive tendering to local authority housing
  management, and examine how to apply it to white-collar services. We will act
  to ensure that private firms bidding to improve local authority public
  services are not obstructed by unscrupulous practices in councils or by unfair
  contracts. We will pursue more competitive tendering for central government
  services.
  We will encourage the wider use of performance pay inside the Civil Service
  and in other parts of the public service. A link between a person's effort and
  his or her pay is a powerful means of improving performance.
  Civil servants dealing with the public will normally identify themselves by
  name.
  We will toughen inspection of key public services where choice and competition
  must inevitably be limited. We will introduce, for the first time, regular
  independent inspection of all schools.
  We will act to ensure that the inspectorates of police, fire, probation, and
  social services, together with any new inspectorates that are established,
  will be truly independent of the service which they inspect.
  We will ensure that the reports from these systematic regular inspections are
  published. More lay inspectors, drawn from other professions and from the
  general public, will bring fresh insights into service improvement.
  We will publish later this year new proposals for the inspection of social
  work in England, setting up arrangements for systematic independent inspection
  of all care services and every local authority social services department.
  Inspections of local authority homes will be carried out by teams that contain
  lay inspectors and are independent of the influence of the management of the
  homes.
All of the privatised utilities have a specialist regulator who is responsible
for promoting competition, reviewing prices and protecting the public interest.
We have introduced legislation to increase the powers of these regulators to the
level of the strongest.
  We are ensuring that the regulators have the powers they need to promote
  competition and safeguard the interests of the customer by controlling price
  increases. We will increase competition in the gas and water markets.
  We are giving the regulators powers to set standards of service, covering such
  matters as fixed appointment times for service calls.
THE POST OFFICE
The Post Office is among the best in Europe for speed and reliability of its
letter services. Traffic has grown by 50 per cent in a decade in which it has
operated without a subsidy Last year the first-class letter service achieved
record improvements in reliability The local post office is a vital and valued
feature of the rural community.
In 1981 we introduced private competition for deliveries costing over £1. This
led to the rapid growth of the private courier industry with substantial
benefits to business users. We believe that further benefits to consumers would
flow from additional competition.
  We are committed to maintaining a nation wide letter service with delivery to
  every address in the United Kingdom, within a uniform structure of prices, and
  with a nation-wide network of post offices.
  We will legislate to set up a new independent regulator to advise on issues
  affecting Post Office customers, and on the progressive introduction of
  competition.
  We will set performance targets for the Post Office and ensure they are
  published in all offices, together with results achieved.
  We will ensure there is effective redress for customers where services fail.
  We will lower the limit on the Post Office monopoly much closer to the level
  of the first class stamp.
  We will provide improved scope for contractors to carry mail to final delivery
  offices.
  We will consider requests to license limited specialist services to compete
  within the Post Office monopoly.
WHITEHALL & WESTMINSTER
Whitehall must move with the times. It is over a decade since the last major
restructuring of the departments of government. Since then:
  Two-thirds of the state industrial sector has been privatised, transferring
  about 900,000 jobs to the private sector.
  Government has reduced the burden of regulation and the need for central
  bureaucracy
  Civil Service manpower has been reduced by almost a quarter.
  Many of the functions of government have been devolved from Whitehall.
  The Citizen's Charter programme is bringing new quality to public services.
We will continue to reorganise central government in tune with its modern role,
while devolving and contracting-out executive functions. We want to ensure that
the drive to save money to reduce bureaucracy and raise quality is powerfully
led from the centre of government.
  We will give a Cabinet Minister responsibility for the Citizen's Charter
  programme and reforming the Civil Service, taking charge of the Citizen's
  Charter Unit, Efficiency Unit, the programme for creating Agencies and the
  Public Competition and Purchasing Unit. This will make it easier to raise
  quality and efficiency in government and see that contracting-out and
  market-testing are energetically pursued.
  We intend to create a new department, under a Cabinet Minister, with
  responsibility for broadcasting, arts, sport, tourism, the national heritage
  and the film industry. This department will aim to encourage private sector
  enterprise in all these fields. The National Lottery and the Millennium Fund
  (detailed later in this Manifesto) will also bring new responsibilities to
  government in these areas.
  We will transfer the core responsibilities of the Department of Energy to the
  Department of Trade and Industry and responsibilities for energy efficiency to
  the Department of the Environment, ending the need for a separate department
  Small businesses are the seedcorn of our future prosperity We believe the
  Department of Trade and Industry should take over responsibility for them. We
  also want to strengthen the links between the DTI and the highly successful
  Training and Enterprise Councils.
  Responsibility for overseeing all financial services will be brought together
  in the Treasury, in line with the practice adopted in most other advanced
  countries.
  New programmes for regenerating our inner cities are outlined in this
  Manifesto. Responsibilities will be brought together in the Department of the
  Environment.
  We are determined to ensure that women in the work-force realise their full
  potential. We will transfer from the Home Office to the Department of
  Employment the lead responsibility for co-ordinating government policy on
  issues of particular concern to women.
OPEN GOVERNMENT
Government has traditionally been far too reluctant to provide information. This
secrecy extends from the processes of Cabinet Government to schools which refuse
to release exam results. Under the Citizen's Charter, a great deal more
information is now being made available on the services provided by government.
We have also:
  replaced the catch-all provisions of the 1911 Official Secrets Act with
  narrower offences depending on specific tests of the harm likely to be caused
  by disclosure, while giving special protection to vital information relating
  to our national security;
  introduced rights to check certain personal records held on computer, and
  supported new rights of access to a range of government records;
  committed ourselves to a public right of access to information about the
  environment, including water supply, air quality dumping at sea and
  radioactive substances;
  made available more reports on matters of public concern such as food safety
  and industrial risks.
We intend to carry forward this move towards greater openness.
  We will review the 80 or so statutory restrictions which exist on the
  disclosure of information - retaining only those needed to protect privacy and
  essential confidentiality.
  We will seek to provide greater access to personal records held by government.

  We will be less secretive about the workings of government. For example, when
  the Committees of the Cabinet are reconstituted after the election we will,
  for the first time, set out their names and membership. We will update and -
  for the first time - publish the guidance for Ministers on procedure.
THE WORKINGS OF PARLIAMENT
It is not just Whitehall that must change. Parliament, too, has to keep its
working methods under review to make sure it attracts the best people to the
service of their country and uses their talents to best effect.
  We will propose appropriate Parliamentary reforms to ensure that the House of
  Commons conducts its business more efficiently and effectively, taking into
  account the benefits of modern technology, the increasing constituency demands
  upon Members of Parliament and the need to attract more women to stand for
  election.
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL
Conservatives believe that high standards in education and training are the key
to personal opportunity and national success. We believe in partnership with
parents, choice in schools and a good grounding in the basic skills all children
need to make a success of their lives. We are committed to widening
opportunities without compromising academic standards. We will continue to
expand higher education and training. We will reinforce the rights of the
individual in the world of work, and break down artificial barriers to
advancement. By extending opportunity and arming people with the power to
choose, we will give valuable freedoms and a powerful spur to achievement.
SCHOOLS, PUPILS & PARENTS
We are now seeing real improvements in our education system. One in four young
people goes on to higher education; at the beginning of the 1980s, it was only
one in eight. Sixty per cent of 16 year-olds stay on in full-time education, up
from only 40 per cent in 1979. And we have embarked on the most important and
wide-ranging reforms since the 1940s.
For the first time in our history, we will soon have a National Curriculum which
will require all the main school subjects to be covered thoroughly The testing
of 7 year-olds is well under way and tests for older children are now being
developed. Starting this September, GCSE courses will be steadily integrated
with the National Curriculum.
Under the Parent's Charter, all schools will have to provide at least one
written report on the progress of each child each year. Information on the
performance of all local schools will be given to parents, enabling them to
exercise choice more effectively
We believe all parents have the right to choice in education - not only those
who can afford school fees. Young people differ in their interests and
aptitudes, and we need a range of schools to offer them the best opportunities.
We have always fought to maintain diversity in education, protecting the right
of local people to preserve their grammar schools, and defending independent
schools against mindless Labour attacks. And we have always valued the important
contribution made by the churches to our children's education.
We have further increased diversity by:
  Giving schools control over their own budgets and encouraging new types of
  school.
  Allowing schools to become independent of local councils, by applying for
  Grant-Maintained status if the parents involved so wish. By mid-1992, over 200
  GM schools will be up and running.
  Creating a number of highly popular City Technology Colleges.
  Launching the highly successful initiative under which schools are able to bid
  directly for the resources to become Technology Schools.
We intend to take all these initiatives further and offer parents more choice in
the new Parliament. Popular schools will be allowed to expand, and more schools
will be able to apply for technology funding. We will make it easier for small
schools to enjoy the benefits of GM status by grouping together.
  We will complete the introduction of the National Curriculum offering 10
  subjects at a nationally-defined standard - English, Mathematics, Science,
  History, Geography, Technology, Art, Music, PE and, in secondary schools, a
  foreign language.
  Regular and straightforward tests will be in place for all 7, 11 and 14
  year-olds by 1994.
  GCSE at age 16 will be integrated into the National Curriculum, with a new A+
  grade to test the most able. The majority of marks will come from a written
  exam.
  We will continue to encourage the creation of nursery places. For the first
  time, over 50 per cent of three and four year olds have places either in
  nursery or primary schools.
  Full information will be published annually about the performance of all local
  schools in each area.
  Independent inspection of schools will provide parents with straightforward
  reports on their child's school, together with an action plan from governors
  to remedy any weaknesses.
  Popular schools which are over subscribed will he given the resources to
  expand.
  GM schools will be able to change their character if that is what parents
  clearly want and the change fits in with the wider needs of the local area.
  The Technology Schools Initiative will be expanded across the country.
  Existing schools which opt for GM status will be able to emulate City
  Technology Colleges and attract private technology sponsorship.
  We will maintain the Assisted Places scheme, which gives access to independent
  education to many families who could not otherwise afford it.
  We will ensure that the partnership between the state and the churches in
  education is maintained and strengthened.
  We will enable small schools to apply for GM status in groups.
  We will pay particular attention to raising educational standards in areas of
  deprivation in our cities.
TEACHING
We are determined to reinforce the professionalism of teachers and the esteem in
which they are held. We have created an independent Teachers' Pay Review Body We
accepted in full its first recommendations; nearly half of all teachers are now
earning over £20,000 a year. We will press ahead with regular appraisal of
teachers to encourage high standards and develop professional skills.
As a first step in the reform of teacher training, postgraduate students will
spend much more time in school classrooms, learning their skills under the
practised eye of senior teachers.
It is vital that the education system should attract back women who have taken a
career break to raise a family Through grants to local authorities, we are
financing schemes to introduce more flexible working practices - such as
job-sharing.
  We will undertake reform of the teacher training system to make it more
  effective in developing classroom skills.
  We will develop measures to encourage women with family responsibilities to
  enter or return to teaching.
AFTER 16
We believe that young people should be free to choose between college,
work-based training and sixth form studies. We are giving further education
colleges and sixth form colleges in England and Wales autonomy, free from
council control. We also value our school sixth forms, and will ensure they
retain their place in the new system. And we will allow them to attract older
students as well. FE colleges will continue to receive support for adult
education, while local authorities will retain the resources to respond to local
demand for leisure courses.
We will defend the well-respected A-level examinations, which Labour would
destroy We will continue to encourage participation m AS examinations. We will
also continue to develop new high-quality National Vocational Qualifications,
and introduce a new post-16 diploma which recognises achievement in both
vocational and academic courses.
  We will develop an Advanced Diploma which can be earned by students pursuing
  either academic or vocational courses, and a new General National Vocational
  Qualification.
  We intend to allow school sixth forms to open their doors if they wish to
  older students, and to accept training credits or fees from them.
  From April next year, further education and sixth form colleges will be
  independent of local government control.
  Mature students will enjoy a wider choice of courses.
HIGHER EDUCATION
Britain maintains the best university system in Europe. We have also developed a
thriving network of polytechnics, whose student numbers have increased nearly
sixfold since the end of the 1960s.
By the year 2000, one in three young people will follow full-time higher
education courses. Meanwhile, the number of mature entrants to higher education
has risen by 65 per cent since 1979. And our universities are attracting
increasing numbers of foreign students.
Despite this huge expansion, our students enjoy one of the most generous support
systems in the world. The introduction of student loans has given students 30
per cent more money for their living costs than the former system of grants
alone. The new system will steadily reduce the proportion of students' living
costs that their parents are expected to meet.
  We will continue to expand the number of students in higher education. We are
  abolishing the artificial 'binary line' between universities and polytechnics.

  We are putting in place new mechanisms to ensure that academic standards are
  maintained in higher education.
  We will continue to provide generous support for students and to expand our
  student loans commitment.
THE TRAINING REVOLUTION
A training revolution is under way in Britain. The Government's job is to create
a framework within which men and women of all ages can develop skills, gain
qualifications and shape their own futures.
We have already brought the world of work and the world of school into closer
harmony Government and industry are working together. Employers already spend
over £20,000 million a year on training. Government spending on training has
increased 2½ times in real terms since 1979, to £2,800 million. The Government's
effort is being channelled through the 82 new Training and Enterprise Councils
(and the Local Enterprise Companies in Scotland) - the most significant peace
time partnership between government and industry this century.
  'Compacts' have resulted in many young people working to goals for attainment
  and attendance in school. In return, they are guaranteed a job with training -
  or training leading to a job.
  This year, two million students will participate in the Technical and
  Vocational Education Initiative.
  Investors in People is the new national standard for companies making a
  commitment to training. TECs play an important role in helping companies
  attain it.
  Employer-led TECs and LECs are delivering Government-funded training
  programmes which reflect industry's understanding of local needs.
  Industry is working closely with the National Council for Vocational
  Qualifications.
  The CBI's training targets for Britain's workforce demonstrate a new
  partnership between business and education.
75 per cent of 16 year-olds stay on in full-time education or Youth Training
schemes, up from 46 per cent in 1979. Since 1983, over 3 million young people
have taken up Youth Training places. And 82 per cent go into jobs or further
education when they complete YT.
Now we are offering young people aged 16 and 17 vouchers they can use to buy
approved courses of education or training, and which will put the power of
choice in their hands.
In 1988, we launched Employment Training, the largest programme of its kind in
Europe, which has since helped 1.2 million people. While local programmes are
the responsibility of the TECs, the Government guarantees the offer of help to
particular groups of unemployed.
Last year, we launched the new Employment Action programme, which will help more
than 61,000 people in a full year. This is a new addition to a range of measures
which include Jobclubs, the Job Interview Guarantee Scheme and other tested
methods of helping unemployed people back to work.
We are also supporting individual training effort. Since 1988, when we launched
Career Development Loans (interest-free for up to 15 months), over 25,000 people
have benefited. Last year's Budget gave tax relief on training fees - a boost to
the 250,000 people a year who finance their own training. Now, with the TECs, we
intend to introduce new financial help for career and training guidance.
  By the end of the new Parliament, the new system of National Vocational
  Qualifications should cover virtually every occupation in the economy. The
  CBI's training targets envisage 80 per cent of young people reaching NVQ level
  2 by the end of the Parliament.
  We intend to make training credits available to all 16 year-olds and 17
  year-olds within the lifetime of the new Parliament. The TECs will continue to
  be responsible for the YT programme for this age group.
  We will continue to finance training programmes for the long-term un-employed
  and those who face particular difficulties. We will launch with the TECs a new
  initiative, giving people a voucher with which they can buy a 'skill check',
  providing assessment and guidance on how to make the most of their working
  lives.
WORKERS AND UNIONS
Over the past 13 years, we have legislated to lift regulatory burdens from the
shoulders of those who create jobs in Britain. To industry's relief, we shunned
the job-destroying European Social Charter. And we reject Labour's
job-destroying notion of a national minimum wage.
We have also legislated five times to transform industrial relations, returning
power from militants to ordinary union members. As a result, the number of days
lost each year through strikes has fallen from an average 12.9 million in the
1970s to less than a million last year - the lowest figure since records began a
century ago.
Labour would disrupt industrial peace by weakening the power of management and
the courts. They propose to take away the courts' most important sanction - the
power to take over a union's assets.
Sympathy strikes would be legalised by Labour, and employers would be prevented
from dismissing strikers who broke their contracts.
The workers' rights we believe in are those which enhance individuals' status
and opportunities. We believe people should be informed and consulted by
employers about issues which affect their work. No one should be allowed to
deduct trade union fees automatically from an employee's pave without written
authorisation. Individuals must be given greater rights to belong to the union
of their choice.
We also believe strongly that employers, employees and customers should not have
their lives and businesses disrupted by wildcat strikes. In the new Parliament,
we will legislate to enforce and enhance these rights.
  We will require employers to give everyone who works for them for more than
  eight hours a week a clear 'written statement of their terms and conditions of
  employment.
  We will make automatic deduction of union membership dues without 'written
  authorisation unlawful.
  We will take measures to give individuals greater freedom in choosing a union.

  We will legislate to require that all pre- strike ballots are postal and
  subject to independent scrutiny, and that at least seven days' notice of a
  strike is given after a ballot.
  People who use public services will have the right to restrain the disruption
  of those services by unlawful industrial action.
A SHARE IN THE FUTURE
We also believe that people at work should be helped to build security for
themselves and their families. Employees should be given every opportunity to
acquire a stake in the business for which they work. We have ruled that
executive share option schemes may grant options at a discount only if the
employer also runs an all-employee scheme.
Saving for a pension reduces reliance on the state. We welcome the provision of
occupational schemes covering over 11 million workers. There are already
important safeguards, which we have improved, for the rights of members in such
schemes. But we believe that a full review of the arrangements is now needed. We
also believe that new freedoms for scheme members will strengthen accountability
and benefit investors.
  We will establish a review of the framework of law and regulation within which
  occupational schemes operate.
  We will give every member of an occupational scheme the right to an annual
  statement of the value of their savings.
  In addition we will examine ways of giving those who retire with lump sum
  payments more choice as to how their savings are invested.
WOMEN AND OPPORTUNITY
A higher proportion of women go out to work in Britain than in an other EC
country except Denmark. Many women choose to work part-time, and our policies
have encouraged the development of part-time work within a framework which
safeguards employees from exploitation.
Throughout Europe, the UK is recognised to have the most comprehensive
legislation to combat sex discrimination. We are also committed to breaking down
artificial barriers to women's advancement based on prejudice or lack of
imagination. As an employer, government must continue to set an example.
The tax relief we have introduced on training fees is constructed to ensure that
non-tax payers - who include many married women - will be able to benefit, too.
Many Training and Enterprise Councils already have specific plans to help women
trainees. We will involve them further in helping employers to help with
childcare.
We believe mothers should be treated equally by government, whether they work
outside the home or not. We are fully committed to maintaining the real value of
child benefit. And we will act where a push by government is needed to stimulate
the provision of childcare.
All employers who meet childcare costs can set these off against their liability
for corporation tax. In addition, we have relieved employees from paying income
tax on the benefit of workplace nurseries.
After-school childcare is an area of particular importance to many working
mothers. We will introduce a new initiative to encourage the provision of
after-school facilities by schools, employers and voluntary groups across the
country.
  The Government will amend the law relating to the employment rights of
  pregnant women to give effect to the EC Directive on Pregnant Workers. This
  addition to our already extensive legal provision will give a right to at
  least 14 weeks' maternity leave and protection against dismissal on grounds of
  pregnancy.
  We will take forward our public appointments initiative. Departments will
  publish plans for between a quarter and a half of public appointments to be
  held by women by 1996.
  We will ensure that all parts of government adopt a strategic approach to the
  employment and development of women staff. We will encourage them to
  participate in the Opportunity 2000 initiative.
  We will continue to oppose EC measures which would discourage part-time
  employment, valued by so many women.
  We will encourage all TECs to adopt plans to help women trainees have equal
  access to training opportunities.
  We will introduce a new grant, paid through TECs, to help employers, voluntary
  groups or schools to set up after-school care and holiday arrangements. We
  will ensure that schools are free to participate.
FREEDOM UNDER THE LAW
The Conservative Party has always stood for the protection of the citizen and
the defence of the rule of law. Society is entitled to a sense of security;
individuals to peace of mind; the guardians of that peace to our whole-hearted
support. Our policies on law and order, and the rights of individuals, are
designed to protect the people of this country and their way of life.
Britain experiences less violent crime than many comparable countries. But crime
has continued to rise in Britain. And the challenge for the 1990s is to step up
the fight against lawlessness and violence, so that our citizens can live free
from fear.
We must continue to ensure that the sentence fits the crime - with long
sentences for dangerous criminals, and fines and a tougher regime for punishment
outside prison available as an alternative for less serious crime. And we must
maintain confidence in our legal system.
We must tackle crime at its roots. Two-thirds of the offences dealt with by our
courts are committed by only seven per cent of those convicted. Most of these
constant offenders started down the path of crime while still of school age.
We have launched a reform of our prisons, improving the prospect that those who
serve custodial sentences will not return to crime.
But above all we must remember that it is our policemen and women who are in the
front line of the battle. To combat crime effectively the police need the full
support of the Government and the public.
POLICE AND THE COMMUNITY
We Conservatives can be proud of our record in supporting the police. Since 1979
we have increased spending on the police by 74 per cent in real terms. Uniformed
manpower has increased by 16,000 and civilian manpower by 12,000. We have
launched a campaign to recruit 10,000 Special Constables.
Over the next few years we want to see a major reform which will help provide
what the public wants and needs: a visible, local police presence.
We will be encouraging police forces to develop local Community Policing, to
link the police more closely with the communities they protect. The Metropolitan
Police will be reorganised on this basis by the spring of 1993. Two-thirds of
English and Welsh forces are already preparing similar plans. Pilot schemes
suggest they can add greatly to the citizen's sense of security and build
support for the police.
Community Policing will involve local residents, listen to their views and
engage their help in the fight against crime. It will mean:
  smaller police units with officers serving the same area for longer. That way,
  people can really get to know their local police officers;
  each police force devolving its management and operational control to local
  units, and streamlining its chain of command;
  getting police back on the beat, and in close contact with the neighbourhoods
  under their care.
It will be supported by an extension of Neighbourhood Watch schemes, which are
vital in deterring theft and burglaries.
Public confidence in the police is enhanced when people know what they can
expect from their local police force, and when outsiders are let into the
process of inspecting how they work. At least five police forces are already
leading the way with charters setting out their targets.
  We are continuing to increase police numbers. There will be 1,000 extra police
  officers this year.
  We will continue to give the police the support and resources they need to
  carry out their duties effectively and efficiently.
  We will be seeking the nation-wide introduction of Community Policing.
  We will encourage civilianisation as a means of freeing police officers for
  operational duties.
  We will encourage the extension of Neighbourhood Watch to more residential
  areas.
  We will continue to increase the Special Constabulary, which has seen a rise
  in recruitment this year of 10 per cent.
  We want each police force to produce a charter telling local people, for
  example, how quickly the police will aim to respond to emergency calls.
  We will introduce lay inspectors with management experience into the police
  inspectorate.
PROTECTORS AND VICTIMS
We look to the police to protect us. They risk their lives to do so. Police
officers are entitled to the protection of the community they serve. Those who
indulge in the shameful practice of 'ambushing', or seeking to frustrate the
work of the emergency services, deserve to face severe penalties. We welcome the
findings of a study by the Home Office and Crown Prosecution Service which shows
that assaults on policemen attract consistently heavier penalties. But we will
examine ways of introducing further protection for the police.
We must also pay special attention to the needs of the victims of crime, in the
courts and in rebuilding their lives. We have increased funding for Victim
Support.
The number of people directly affected by violent and sexual crime remains
relatively small. But fear of crime can have a devastating effect on people's
lives, and particularly on women's lives. We are determined to reduce this fear.

  We will set up a working party to examine what more can be done to protect the
  police and members of other emergency services from assault.
  We will encourage victims to report sexual offences by giving them statutory
  anonymity
  Under our Safer Cities programme, there are 124 schemes to improve street
  lighting, which has been shown to reduce the fear of crime significantly.
  Women-only taxi services are being encouraged under the same Safer Cities
  programme.
PENALTIES AND PREVENTION
Our armoury of criminal law and penalties requires constant review. We have just
introduced a new law specifically aimed at the so-called 'joy-rider'. This
places the responsibility for dangerous driving, damage, injury or death
following from the taking of a vehicle squarely on the shoulders of those in it.

Even where 'joy-riding' is not involved, causing death through dangerous or
drink driving is a very serious offence. We believe that the maximum sentence
for such a crime should reflect its gravity.
Squatting is nothing less than the seizure of another's property without
consent. Having consulted widely on the subject, we have decided to extend the
criminal law dealing with squatting.
Illegal camping by gypsies or other travellers can affect the lives of whole
communities. We believe that this problem must be tackled.
We are concerned about the small but persistent minority, particularly of young
people, who re-offend while already on bail. We have announced new measures to
deter them from repeated crime.
Young people who find themselves on probation for shop-lifting, vandalism or
petty thuggery should be shown where the path of crime may lead. They should be
given a brief personal experience of the nature of prison life.
  'Joy-riders' will now face prison sentences of up to 5 years, unlimited fines
  and unlimited driving bans.
  We will extend the maximum sentence for causing death through dangerous or
  drink driving.
  We will create a new criminal offence of squatting, to give greater protection
  to the owners and occupants of shops, commercial premises, houses and flats.
  The 1968 Caravan Sites Act will be reviewed with the aim of reducing the
  nuisance of illegal encampments.
  As part of a community sentence, young offenders will be taken to see what
  life is really like inside one of our prisons - a sobering experience for
  them.
  We will introduce a new police power to make an arrest for breach of police
  bail.
  We will give the courts the statutory power to increase sentences for those
  who offend while on bail.
  We will increase the number of bail hostel places, to enable closer
  supervision of those on bail.
  We will mount a drive against school truancy, and set up a Task Force to find
  the best ways of co-ordinating the work of local agencies helping young people
  at risk of becoming offenders.
REFORMING OUR PRISONS
Prisons should be places which are austere but decent, providing a busy and
positive regime which prepares prisoners for their ultimate release.
We have been reversing the Labour Party's neglect of the prison service in the
1970s. Since 1985, 14 new prisons have been opened 7 more will open over the
next two years. The end of overcrowding is now in sight.
We have already taken steps to implement the key recommendations of the Woolf
report on the future of our prisons. We will bring private sector skills in to
enhance efficiency and increase value for money
We have put out to tender the contract for prison escort services, an approach
which has worked well in other countries. The first contract for a privately
managed remand centre has been awarded.
  We will sustain our massive prison reform and building programme.
  A reconstruction programme will end the degrading need for 'slopping out' by
  the end of 1994.
  We will reorganise prisoners' education, training and work opportunities.
  We will establish the Prison Service as a separate agency, whose director will
  have the clear responsibility for day-to day operations. The Home Secretary
  will remain ministerially accountable to Parliament for prison policy.
  We will increase the use of private sector management skills.
OUR LEGAL SYSTEM
As a free society we must have a justice system that is fair, accessible and
responsive to the citizen.
We have introduced new powers for the Court of Appeal to increase sentences for
crime. And in response to public concern about a small but significant number of
miscarriages of justice, we have appointed a Royal Commission to review aspects
of the criminal justice system, including the conduct of investigations, the
handling of forensic evidence, and the powers of the Court of Appeal.
We have already reduced the opportunity for abuse by our introduction of
tape-recorded interviews of suspects by the police. At the same time, we are
concerned that police investigations should not be made more difficult by the
misuse of certain rights.
We have already introduced a wide range of reforms following our Civil Justice
Review. Extending the jurisdiction of the County Courts has helped speed up
justice. The success of the small claims system in these courts has shown that
simplified procedures can enable people to conduct their own cases or rely on a
lay adviser. We have also introduced a reform which will give people more choice
as to who represents them legally in court.
We are committed to enabling people with limited means to have access to legal
services. We are determined to ensure that these services are delivered
efficiently, in a way which provides the best value for money.
The principles of the Citizen's Charter are being applied to our legal system.
We will shortly be publishing a Courts Charter.
We are overhauling the way in which family matters are handled in our courts.
The new family code will be applied by magistrates and judges especially trained
in family law.
Our Sunday Trading laws have come into question as a result of a possible
conflict with Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome. This matter is now before the
European Court of Justice, and we are awaiting a judgement. The Government
brought forward proposals in 1986 to reform the shopping laws, but Parliament
was not able to agree a conclusion. Parliament will be given the opportunity to
consider this issue again.
  We will introduce a major Criminal Justice Bill in the lifetime of the new
  Parliament.
  We will extend the types of cases which can be handled by the County Courts in
  a simplified way.
  We will consult on a Lay Adjudicators scheme to make it easier for citizens to
  settle disputes with service providers.
  We will provide a code of family law that will continue to underpin the
  institution of marriage, give priority to the welfare of the child, and
  emphasise the primary responsibility of parents for the welfare of children
  and the family.
  We will bring forward proposals for reform of the Sunday Trading laws once the
  legal position has been made clear by the European Court of Justice.
PORNOGRAPHY, PRIVACY, LIBEL
We have the toughest anti-pornography laws in Western Europe, and we will keep
them that way.
Every year, about 300,000 people - mostly women - request advice and assistance
in dealing with obscene or malicious phone calls. We intend to do more to deter
this harassment, in conjunction with the telecommunications industry.
The Press Complaints Commission is now in operation, and we will monitor its
work carefully to see if self-regulation succeeds.
The public's dislike of unprincipled press behaviour has sometimes been
expressed in the award of erratically large libel damages. While this is
understandable, it has led to an inordinate number of successful appeals. We
therefore propose to simplify the law relating to libel in the light of the
recommendations of the Neill Committee.
  British domestic controls on pornography will remain in place even after the
  completion of the Single European Market.
  We will increase the maximum penalties for making obscene or malicious phone
  calls.
  We propose to allow judges to settle the level of damages in libel cases where
  the defendant offers to pay to make amends.
COMMUNITY RELATIONS
Racial harmony demands restraint on all sides, and a tolerant understanding of
the legitimate views of others.
Everybody, regardless of ethnic background, religious or personal belief, has
the right to go about his or her life free from the threat of intimidation and
assault. We are determined that everyone lawfully settled in this country should
enjoy the full range of opportunities in our society That requires openness on
the part of the majority and, on the part of the ethnic minorities themselves, a
determination to participate fully in the life of the wider community.
The Home Office invests £129 million in grants designed to encourage those
running public services to ensure that people from ethnic minorities can enjoy
the full range of public services - such as health, housing and social services.
We believe that these grants would be more effective if responsibility was
transferred to those Departments which can make best use of the money.
  Racial and sexual discrimination have no place in our society. We have given
  the police stronger powers to deal with racial hatred. We will continue to
  ensure that the full force of the law is used to deal with racial attacks.
  We will transfer the education share of the Home Office's 'Section 11' money
  to the Department of Education, to focus help on those from ethnic minority
  backgrounds who need additional English language teaching.
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEES
Good community relations in this country depend upon a clear structure of
immigration controls which are fair, understandable and properly enforced. We
are determined to maintain our present system of immigration controls unless we
have evidence that other arrangements would be equally satisfactory and
cost-effective.
But an increasing number of would-be immigrants from Eastern Europe and other
parts of the world seek to abuse our openness to genuine refugees. The number of
people seeking refugee status has risen from 5,000 a year to 45,000 over the
past four years.
We will continue to honour our commitment to the 1951 UN Convention, and give
refuge to those who reach our shores with a well-founded fear of persecution.
  In the new Parliament we must therefore reintroduce the Asylum Bill, opposed
  by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, to create a faster and more effective
  system of determining who are genuine political refugees, and who are not.
  We will provide a fair and expeditious system for examining claims for refugee
  status. This will include a workable appeal system for applicants under which
  those with manifestly unfounded claims will be returned quickly to their own
  country or to the country they came from.
  Finger-printing will be introduced for asylum applicants, to prevent multiple
  applications and fraudulent benefit claims.
THE DANGER OF DRUGS
Illegal drug abuse poses a major threat to the fabric of our society. It can
destroy the health and lives of young people in particular. We will tackle this
problem with vigour.
We have already taken action on a wide front:
  we have set up co-ordinators in every local education authority to train
  teachers about the harm drugs can do, and to bring the fight against drug
  abuse into the classroom;
  we have set up 16 local drug prevention teams in inner cities to tackle
  particular problem areas;
  we have created the National Drugs Intelligence Unit at New Scotland Yard;
  we have taken the lead in Europe in pressing for the establishment of a
  Europe-wide Drugs Unit, as a first step towards a creation of a
  we have set up a network of 31 drug liaison officers, in 19 different
  countries, tracking the international drugs traffickers who threaten Britain
  with their trade.
We now have the toughest sanctions in Western Europe against drug traffickers.
A number of public services and voluntary bodies are engaged in fighting drug
misuse at local level. Such efforts need co-ordination to ensure that local
effort and dedication is directed to best effect.
  We will not legalise any banned drugs.
  We will bring forward proposals to ensure that the control of drug misuse is
  co-ordinated effectively.
  We intend to strengthen our confiscatory powers still further. And we will
  ensure that our controls against drug-trafficking are not weakened by any
  changes in Europe.
  We will make it an offence to supply anabolic steroids to minors.
THE THREAT OF TERRORISM
Tragic and dangerous events remind us only too frequently of the need for the
special measures provided by the Prevention of Terrorism Act. While Labour
proposes to weaken or dismantle them, we know that for the safety of our
citizens they must be continued, and the police effort against terrorism must be
reinforced.
We have set up in New Scotland Yard arrangements to co-ordinate the activities
of all our police forces in the fight against terrorism.
  We will provide the necessary measures and resources to combat terrorism,
  whether it comes from the IRA or other evil groups who seek to undermine our
  democracy.
RESPONSIBILITY FOR OTHERS
Conservatives believe we have responsibility one for another. We will continue
to care for those in need and work to establish a society that is generous, as
well as prosperous. Our health, care and social security systems are fundamental
to government responsibilities; and we believe strongly in fostering voluntary
services too.
THE NHS - PRESENT AND FUTURE
The Conservative Party is totally committed to the National Health Service. The
Government has set out in the Patient's Charter the principles on which the NHS
is based. The most fundamental of these is that need, and not ability to pay, is
and will remain the basis on which care is offered to all by the NHS. Since
1979, there have been great improvements in the health of the nation.
  Life expectancy has increased by two years.
  Deaths amongst babies and very young children have gone down by 40 per cent.
  hospitals are treating well over a million more people a year as in-patients.
  hospitals are treating over two million more people a year as out-patients.
  kidney transplants have more than doubled.
  hip replacements have increased by over 50 per cent.
  coronary artery by-passes have nearly tripled.
Since 1979 the Government has vastly increased the resources available to the
NHS.
  We have increased overall funding for the NHS by 55 per cent after allowing
  for inflation. The cash increases in each of the three years up to 1992-93
  have been the biggest ever.
  The number of doctors and dentists has been increased by 17,000, and the real
  resources committed to GP services have doubled since 1979.
  The number of nurses and midwives has gone up by 69,000.
  We have established the independent Pay Review Body which nurses had sought
  for so long, and increased their pay by 43 per cent. It is hard now to
  remember that Labour actually cut nurses' pay.
  We have restored the hospital building programme so savagely cut by Labour at
  the end of their last term of office.
But the Conservative Government has not simply spent more money on the NHS.
  We have reformed the organisation of the NHS to encourage those working in the
  service to respond to what patients want and need, and to get the most out of
  the increased money which the taxpayer provides.
At local level, health authorities now have the task of buying health care with
their local share of the National Health budget. Hospitals can now be run by
their own local team of doctors, nurses and managers. By April there will be 156
NHS Trusts whose local boards will have extra freedoms to develop local NHS
services. Another 156 hospitals have applied to become trusts from April 1993.
We have acted to reduce the long hours worked by junior doctors in hospitals.
For the first time limits are being set on the number of hours which may be
worked continuously.
Good nursing is the essential complement to good medicine. We have introduced
Project 2000 - a new approach to the professional training of nurses.
The GP has a crucial role to play in the development of health services. Under
the Government's fund- holding initiative, doctors have control over their own
spending on behalf of patients for the first time. Over 3,000 GPs will be
fundholders by April, caring for 14 per cent of NHS patients. A further 2,500
are preparing to become fundholders in April 1993. As a result, new services are
being offered at local surgeries and health centres. Many general practitioners
have said that they would like to become involved in fund-holding. We have
already extended the scope of the fund-holding scheme to allow general
practitioners to provide services such as community nursing.
  We will, year by year, increase the level of real resources committed to the
  NHS. Savings made through greater efficiency will be ploughed back into the
  Service.
  We will develop a comprehensive research and development strategy for the NHS.

  We will continue to develop the NHS Trust movement which places responsibility
  for managing hospitals and other services with local teams who are closest to
  patients.
  We will continue to encourage the involvement of doctors and other medical
  staff in the management of services.
  We will introduce powers for nurses to prescribe where appropriate.
  We will complete the implementation of Project 2000 training for nurses.
  We will set goals for the employment of women in professional and managerial
  posts in the NHS.
  We will ensure that, following maternity leave or a career break, all women
  working in the NHS, including those returning to nursing on a part-time or
  job-sharing basis, are able to return to work of a similar status or level to
  that which they left.
  We will ensure that the benefits of fund- holding arrangements are available
  to any GP who wishes to apply, and we will be ready to extend the scope of the
  scheme further as it develops.
THE PATIENT'S CHARTER
No one questions the dedication of those who work in the NHS But before the
Government's reforms, the system did not always allow that dedication to produce
the service which people should be able to expect.
The Patient's Charter sets out clearly what is now expected from the NHS. We
have already pledged that in future no one will wait more than two years for
treatment on the NHS. In many parts of the country for most treatments, the
waiting time is much shorter than this; and we will seek further progress in
reducing waiting times.
  Binding guarantees will be set locally for in-patient waiting times, starting
  with the operations where waiting causes most distress. To ensure that
  progress on waiting times continues, we intend that from 31 March 1993, no one
  should have to wait more than 18 months for a hip or knee replacement, or a
  cataract operation. We are sure that, as now, many hospitals will be able to
  do better than this.
  We will move to a system under which a named nurse or midwife will be
  responsible for your care while you are in hospital.
  We will set specific targets for out patient waiting times.
  We will make it easier for patients to find out what services are available
  from the NHS via a new national NHS information service.
  We will ensure that comparative information about the health standards
  achieved by health authorities is available to the public.
  Simple systems will be set up to allow complaints to be registered and
  responses given if things go wrong.
STRATEGY FOR HEALTH
This Government has embarked on the first ever strategy for health. Good health
requires more than good NHS care when people are sick. A variety of factors -
including preventive medicine, diet, exercise, sensible drinking and not smoking
- can contribute substantially to improving health across the whole population.
  We will set health objectives to be achieved by the end of the century,
  including reductions in illness and death from heart disease and cancers.
  We will add new health objectives as the strategy develops.
CARE SERVICES
Care services for children, the elderly and the handicapped are provided by
local government, health authorities, the private sector and voluntary groups,
not directly by central government. But government is indirectly involved as the
provider of taxpayers money and through its duty to set standards for publicly
and privately provided care.
As the number of elderly people in the population grows, there will be more
frail and vulnerable citizens who need support. Many of them will want to be
cared for at home. Others will need residential or nursing home care. It is
vital that people should have choice in the type of care available. In all cases
people must be able to rely on the quality of care. As we move towards
implementation of 'Caring for People' in April 1993:
  We will take steps to ensure that individuals who need residential or nursing
  care continue to have a choice of homes, including independent homes. Money
  transferred from the Social Security budget to local social services
  departments will be used for this purpose.
  We will ensure that all local authorities publish information about the social
  services that are available, including information on standards and complaints
  procedures.
  We will provide choice in domiciliary and day care.
  We will provide further funding for voluntary organisations to play their
  vital part in the development of community care services.
  We will support the organisations which help those who care for friends and
  relatives at home.
CHILDREN
This Government introduced the Children Act, a landmark in legislation to
protect children. The Act requires childcare facilities to be registered to
ensure that standards are maintained throughout the country
We believe that the diversity of childcare provision in the UK is one of its
strengths. It offers parents real choice. Over 90 per cent of 3-4 year-olds are
engaged in some form of group activity We shall continue to encourage the
development of childcare arrangements in the voluntary and independent sectors.
  Each local authority will be asked to produce a Local Childcare Plan setting
  out the provision available in their area.
  We will ensure that the standards implemented through the Children Act are
  applied sensibly, and do not discourage private or voluntary arrangements
  which are often best suited to the needs of children and parents.
  We will carry forward a family support initiative, encouraging the voluntary
  sector to work in partnership with families and local authorities.
SOCIAL SECURITY
Our aim is to improve further and modernise Britain's social security system. We
are providing more support than ever before £14 for every £10 spent in 1979,
after allowing for inflation. More importantly, this extra help is more clearly
focused on those groups with the greatest needs - less well-off pensioners,
disabled people and low income families.
We have also sought to provide those on social security with better incentives
to earn, and gain independence. All too often the old system created barriers to
work and penalised the thrifty.
The benefit structure is now more flexible and easier to understand. The new
Benefits Agency is simplifying forms and widening choice in methods of payment.
We will complete the massive investment in new technology - Europe's biggest
computerisation project - that has made it possible to raise the quality of
service to the public. And we will extend 'Helplines' and other means of
assistance with individual difficulties.
  We will continue to simplify social security forms wherever possible.
  We will set up a new Family Credit telephone advice service to support working
  families.
  We will establish a new agency to carry out all social security war pensions
  work with the aim of providing a better, more efficient service to war
  pensioners and war widows.
SECURITY IN RETIREMENT
Britain's pensioners recognise the security that Conservative government brings
- low inflation, savings that grow, firmness in the face of crime, public
services that put the customer first. Those who have dedicated their lives to
the service of the community deserve that stability
We will continue to give the fight against inflation our first priority The
basic state retirement pension will remain the foundation for retirement. We
will continue to protect its value against price rises, as we have for the last
13 years.
We also recognise that some pensioners, who have no savings or pensions from
their jobs, need extra help. So we will increase the additional support, already
up by over £300 million a year since 1989, available to less well-off
pensioners.
The number of those over pensionable age will be far higher in the next century
than it is today If we do not make provision now; the burden we will place on
our children will be too great. That is why we must encourage people to build up
savings, investments, and occupational and personal pensions.
But Labour policy is hostile to such personal effort; Labour wants pensioners to
depend on the State. Failure to control inflation meant that pensioners' incomes
from savings were cut under the last Labour Government.
About eight in ten pensioners have some sort of second income to top up their
state pension. By abolishing the hated earnings rule we have enabled pensioners
to keep their retirement pension, even if they take a job in retirement. And we
have increased the level of savings that is disregarded in working out
entitlement to benefits for pensioners. Personal pensions have brought real
choice into retirement provision. Over 4½ million people have set up their own
pensions since 1988. We want to see both occupational and personal provision
expand much further in the course of the 1990s. (See 'Opportunity for all - A
share in the future' for our proposals on occupational pensions.)
  As evidence of our continuing commitment to poorer pensioners, we have
  announced in the Budget an increase of £2 a week for single people, £3 a week
  for couples, in income support for pensioners. Combined with the increases
  this April, this measure will provide less well-off pensioners with between
  £5.73 and £10.70 a week extra.
  We will continue to pay, from April 1993, a rebate at the level recommended by
  the Government Actuary for all those who contract out of the State Earnings.
  Related Pension Scheme.
  We will legislate to provide a new 1 per cent incentive for holders of
  personal pensions aged 30 and over from April 1993, when the existing
  incentive ends.
  We will consider proposals for a new system of rebates to come into effect
  from April 1996 with the aim of ensuring that personal pensions remain
  attractive across the age range.
  We are firmly committed to equal treatment for men and women in pensions.
  Following assessment of the responses to our discussion paper, we will bring
  forward legislation to achieve this.
SUPPORTING FAMILIES
Our reforms have cut away the barriers that meant many breadwinners lost money
if they went to work. Family Credit has transformed the prospects of 350,000
low-income families. As a result of improvements since 1988, we have made
available an extra £600 million a year in real terms to low- income families
with children.
But we also recognise that all families face extra costs in bringing up
children. So we have raised Child Benefit. For a two-child family the increases
we are making will, by April 1992, have raised the total value of Child Benefit
by almost £3 in a single year, to £17.45 a week.
Our new Child Support Agency will make sure that absent parents make a proper
contribution - and that far more lone parents and their children get the
maintenance that is theirs by right. And benefit changes make it easier for more
families - including single parents - to combine work and family
responsibilities.
  Child Benefit will remain the cornerstone of our policy for all families with
  children. Its value will increase each year in line with prices.
  Child Benefit will continue to be paid to all families, normally to the
  mother, and in respect of all children.
HELP FOR DISABLED PEOPLE
Under the Conservatives, more disabled people than ever before are getting the
help they need and deserve. Since 1979, the number receiving Attendance
Allowance has more than trebled; the number receiving Mobility Allowance has
risen six fold; the number receiving Invalid Care Allowance has risen 25-fold.
Today we spend some £12,000 million a year on benefits for long-term sick and
disabled people. Even after allowing for inflation, that is 2½ times as much as
Labour spent in the 1970s.
  Disability Living Allowance will bring together the existing Attendance and
  Mobility Allowance, providing new help to many disabled people who at present
  get no such help. Disability Working Allowance will make it easier for
  disabled people to take up a job.
  We are introducing new disability benefits which will, in the next Parliament,
  bring extra help to at least 300,000 people. By 1993-94 these and other
  improvements will mean that we will be directing an extra £300 million a year
  to long-term sick and disabled people.
  The Independent Living Fund has proved a great success in giving severely
  disabled people an opportunity to live in the community. We are committed to
  maintaining a fluid which supports the most severely disabled people.
THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR
Charities and voluntary groups play a vital role in our national life. Britain
is rich in its citizens' willingness to give time, effort and money to helping
others. We have a great tradition of voluntary work at home and overseas. There
are now about 350,000 voluntary groups in Britain - and personal donations to
charities now amount to some £5,000 million a year.
We have done much to boost charitable giving.
  Under the Payroll Giving Scheme, employees can now contribute up to £50 a
  month tax-free.
  Gifts and bequests have been exempted from Inheritance Tax.
  The Gift Aid scheme allows charities to claim tax relief on one-off gifts of
  more than £400 - a change just announced in the Budget.
  The maximum limit on single charitable gifts qualifying for Income and
  Corporation Tax relief has been abolished.
The new Charities legislation will ensure that charities are better managed and
properly regulated. We believe this will enhance public confidence in charities
and further boost charitable giving.
The Government gives some £2,500 million a year to support the activities of the
voluntary sector (including housing associations). Industry has been generous
with its sponsorship and with technical support. But money is not the only
contribution that government and business can make. Businesses have become much
more practically involved in work in the community And government could do more
to encourage new forms of volunteering, to encourage the most effective use of
the money it gives, and to bring together voluntary effort at the local and
national level.
  We will continue to support the work of the voluntary sector and promote
  volunteering.
  We will work with voluntary agencies to develop, over the life of the next
  Parliament, a national bank of information on opportunities for volunteering.
  We will encourage efforts to improve the co-ordination and promote the growth
  of local volunteer support, building on the success of Neighbourhood Watch to
  develop a network of voluntary help in local communities.
ANIMAL WELFARE
We are leading the European Community in our achievements in improving animal
welfare. We have also taken action at home and abroad to improve conservation,
and will continue to do so.
English Nature, which advises the Government on wildlife issues, has embarked on
an ambitious programme to restore endangered species. The Wildlife and
Countryside Act 1981 provides special protection for 304 species of birds and
animals, as well as protecting our heritage of wild plants.
We are firmly opposed to international trade in rare and protected species such
as rhinoceroses, cheetahs, leopards, and bears. We have pushed successfully for
an EC ban on large-scale drift nets that threatened dolphins, and we support the
UN resolution calling for a moratorium on their use. We support the extension of
the moratorium on commercial whaling and have co-sponsored resolutions against
'scientific' hunting of whales. We have successfully pressed for an EC ban on
the importation of baby seal products and of furs from those countries which
permit leghold traps.
We have set up the Farm Animal Welfare Council and have brought in welfare codes
covering livestock on farms and in transit. We are establishing an ethical
committee to look at the effects of advanced techniques in animal breeding. We
have banned the use of veal crates, and taken action to ensure humane slaughter.
We insisted that we should retain our power to stop the export of live horses.
At Maastricht we secured a landmark in animal welfare: our partners' agreement
to a declaration that the welfare of animals should be taken into account in the
framing of EC legislation.
We now have the toughest set of controls on animal experimentation in Europe,
and the number of animals used in experiments has fallen steadily We have
supported stronger laws to protect badgers and stop cruel tethering, and have
increased the penalties for organising animal fights and for cruelty.
  We will introduce a Wildlife Enhancement Scheme and expand the Species
  Recovery Scheme, both to be run by English Nature.
  We have tightened controls on the import of wild birds and will press the EC
  to do the same.
  We oppose resumption of the trade in ivory or elephant products, and will
  provide additional support for elephant conservation projects in Africa.
  We will urge our EC partners to bring animal welfare standards up to UK
  levels, for example by banning veal crates and stalls and tethers for pigs. We
  will press them to put into practice the principles of the Maastricht
  declaration.
  We will use our EC Presidency to toughen up EC regulations and improve EC
  compliance with rules governing animal experiments.
  We will press for higher EC standards for the keeping of battery hens and for
  the care of animals in transit.
  We will not accept any weakening of our rabies prevention safeguards.
A BRIGHTER BRITAIN
Making Britain a brighter and better place in which to live requires a high
quality physical environment - including housing, transport and reinvigorated
urban areas. The Conservative commitment is both to the re-creation of our civic
pride and also to the preservation and integrity of our rural heritage, founded
on the core industry of agriculture. Our aim is to enhance the quality of life
for the British people.
HOME OWNERSHIP
The opportunity to own a home and pass it on is one of the most important rights
an individual has in a free society Conservatives have extended that right. It
lies at the heart of our philosophy We want to see wealth and security being
passed down from generation to generation. Some 4 million more householders own
their own homes compared with 1979. The number of former council tenants who
have bought their homes has risen to 1.4 million.
We now need to make it easier for those council tenants living in high-cost
areas or on low incomes to move gradually into home ownership, without taking on
too heavy a financial burden at any one time. This will bring the benefits of
home ownership within the reach of more people and introduce more diversity in
local authority estates. We also want to help more leaseholders to own and
control the management of their property.
But we recognise that not everyone can, or will want to, buy his or her home. So
we are determined to encourage a strong private rented sector while continuing
to safeguard the rights of existing regulated tenants. Bringing empty private
sector dwellings back into use will extend choice, make it easier for people to
move jobs, and help tackle homelessness.
  We will maintain mortgage tax relief.
  We will continue 'Right to Buy' discounts, and ensure that local authorities
  respond reasonably and rapidly to applications.
  We will introduce a new nation-wide 'Rents to Mortgages' scheme, enabling
  council tenants to take a part-share in their home, gradually stepping up to
  full ownership.
  We will put more of the Housing Corporation's £2,000 million budget into
  Do-It-Yourself shared ownership. This will enable first time buyers to choose
  a home and buy a share of it - usually 50 per cent - with a housing
  association paying rent on the rest until they wish to increase their stake in
  the property.
  We will introduce 'Commonhold' legislation, giving residential leaseholders
  living in blocks of flats the right to acquire the freehold of their block at
  the market rate. Leaseholders of higher rated houses will also be given the
  right to buy the freehold of their property. Leaseholders who live in a block
  which does not qualify will have a new right to buy an extended lease.
  We will introduce statutory time limits for answers by local authorities to
  standard inquiries by house-buyers, and explore the idea of a new computerised
  Property Data Bank bringing together information held by the Land Registry and
  other public bodies.
  We will extend nation-wide the scheme we have piloted to increase private
  renting, whereby housing associations manage properties, building trust
  between tenant and private sector landlord.
  As soon as possible in the new Parliament, we will introduce a flew 'Rent a
  Room' scheme wider which home-owners will be able to let rooms to lodgers
  without haying to pay tax on the rent they receive.
MEETING HOUSING NEED
We are also committed to securing a better deal for council tenants and
increasing the supply of affordable housing for those in housing need. We will
introduce more choice, improve management of estates and create new rights as
part of the Tenant's Charter. Our aim will be to give tenants a choice of
landlord wherever possible, and make management of both council and housing
association stock more responsive to the needs of tenants.
We will improve the way in which council housing is managed by bringing in new
private sector providers operating on contract to the local authority We will
introduce more competition and choice, thereby improving services to the tenant
and increasing accountability. And we intend to give council tenants new
opportunities themselves to improve the flat or house in which they live.
We have already begun a process of Large-Scale Voluntary Transfer which allows
local authority tenants to opt to transfer to a housing association. We wish to
see this result in diversity, not local monopoly, and will therefore act to
limit the size of blocks that can be transferred.
Nearly all new social housing is now being built by housing associations. Over
the next three years, we are committed to spend nearly £6,000 million through
the Housing Corporation to provide 153,000 homes.
We will do more to bring into use properties owned by central and local
government which are standing empty for no good reason. This will enable us to
house more people on the waiting list and, in some cases, to provide more
opportunities for homesteading.
Through Estate Action and Housing Action Trusts we have invested £1,000 million
in recent years in a concentrated attack on the country's worst housing estates.
Some 360,000 dwellings have been improved as a result. As part of those
programmes, on which we are committed to spend a further £1,400 million over the
next three years, we are demolishing or redesigning tower blocks and deck access
estates, rebuilding on a more human scale. Wherever we can, whenever tenants
want it, and where resources allow; we will pull down the eyesores which have
blotted our cityscapes and too often provided breeding grounds for crime and
delinquency.
The Government is spending about £100 million tackling the problem of rough
sleeping in our cities. As a result we have seen a sharp fall in the numbers who
sleep rough on our streets. Working closely with the voluntary sector we will
continue to provide help for those sleeping rough, particularly in the capital.
  We will revolutionise the management of council houses and flats. Compulsory
  competitive tendering will oblige local authorities to bring in managers who
  demonstrate their ability to deliver the best services to tenants.
  We will continue our programme of Large Scale Voluntary Transfer of council
  properties to housing associations. But in order to bring management closer to
  tenants, we intend to reduce the limit on the number of properties transferred
  in a single batch.
  We will give tenants a new Right to Improve, so they can receive compensation
  for certain home improvements which they undertake. And we will improve the
  existing Right to Repair. We will continue our Estate Action and Housing
  Action Trust programmes which concentrate resources on the worst council
  estates.
  We will enable tenants to apply for Housing Action Trusts to take over and
  improve the worst estates.
  We will work with the Housing Corporation to establish a new Ombudsman for
  housing association tenants. We will also encourage the Corporation to extend
  opportunities for tenant involvement in the management of housing association
  properties.
  We will set up a Task Force - headed by an independent chairman - to help
  bring empty government residential properties back into use. These will either
  be sold or let on short term leases to those in housing need.
  As part of Estate Action we will introduce a new pilot scheme to promote
  homesteading. Local authorities will be encouraged to offer those in housing
  need the opportunity to restore and improve council properties. In exchange,
  homesteaders will pay a lower rent or be able to buy at a reduced price.
TRANSPORT
Under the Conservatives, transport in Britain is being transformed. More
competition on the roads and in the air has led to better services and more
choice. Our successful policies of deregulation and privatisation have gone hand
in hand with a sustained and growing programme of investment. Over 1,000 miles
of new trunk roads and motorway have been built, more than 100 bypasses
constructed, and some 750 miles of railway electrified. Airlines now operate 50
per cent more flights. More people travel further and more easily than ever
before.
Over the next three years we are committed to the biggest investment in
Britain's transport infrastructure in our history
We will also seek further opportunities for the private sector to contribute, as
it has for example with the Channel Tunnel, the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge at
Dartford, the second Severn Bridge and the Birmingham Northern Ring Road. We
intend the proposed new rail link from the Channel Tunnel to King's Cross to be
taken forward by the private sector.
THE RAILWAYS
We believe that the railways can play a bigger part in responding to Britain's
growing transport needs, and are investing accordingly Next year alone, British
Rail's external finance will top £2,000 million. The new Passenger's Charter
will help to raise the quality of service. For the first time ever performance
targets will be set, widely published and rigorously monitored; fare levels will
reflect the standards set; and discounts will be paid to regular travellers
where performance targets are not met.
We believe that the best way to produce profound and lasting improvements on the
railways is to end BR's state monopoly We want to restore the pride and local
commitment that died with nationalisation. We want to give the private sector
the opportunity to operate existing rail services and introduce new ones, for
both passengers and freight.
A significant number of companies have already said that they want to introduce
new railway services as soon as the monopoly is ended. We will give them that
chance.
Our plans for the railways are designed to bring better services for all
passengers as rapidly as possible. We believe that franchising provides the best
way of achieving that. Long term, as performance improves and services become
more commercially attractive as a result of bringing in private sector
disciplines, it will make sense to consider whether some services can be sold
outright.
In the next Parliament:
  By franchising, we will give the private sector the fullest opportunity to
  operate existing passenger railway services.
  Required standards of punctuality, reliability and quality of service will be
  specified by franchises; subsidy will continue to be provided where necessary;
  arrangements to sustain the current national network of services will be
  maintained; and through-ticketing will be required.
  A new Rail Regulator - who will ensure that all companies have fair access to
  the track - will award the franchises and make sure that the franchisees
  honour the terms of the contract.
  BR's accounting systems and internal structures will be reorganised. One part
  of BR will continue to be responsible for all track and infrastructure. The
  operating side of BR will continue to provide passenger services until they
  are franchised out to the private sector.
  The franchise areas will be decided only after technical discussions with BR.
  But our aim will be to franchise out services in such a way as to reflect
  regional and local identity and make operating sense. We want to recover a
  sense of pride in our railways and to recapture the spirit of the old regional
  companies.
  We will sell BR's freight operations outright. We will also sell its parcels
  business.
  We will be prepared to sell stations - which we want to be centres of activity
  - either to franchisees or independent companies.
  The Railway Inspectorate will be given full powers to ensure the highest
  standards of safety.
ROADS
Nine out of every ten journeys, whether passenger or freight, are made by road.
We must therefore continue to provide an efficient road network. In the years
ahead we will concentrate particularly on the bypass programme.
As part of the Citizen's Charter, we will bring forward reforms which will
enable the private sector to start filling the gaps in the motorway service area
network and to introduce more variety Rather than large, intrusive stations at
long intervals we should see smaller, more frequent service areas providing a
much wider range of facilities.
We will investigate ways of speeding up, within the Department of Transport, the
procedures for building new roads. We will continue our campaign to keep 'coning
off' on motorways to a minimum by extending lane rental schemes, under which
contractors who fall behind schedule incur financial penalties. Next year
two-thirds of all motorway maintenance work will be carried out in this way.
Britain has the best road safety record in the European Community In spite of
the vastly increased volume of traffic, fewer people are now killed on our roads
than at any time since 1948. Our aim is to improve on that record still further.

In spite of the benefits they bring, cars carry an environmental cost. In
Britain catalytic converters will be compulsory on all new cars from the end of
1992. This will eliminate virtually all harmful exhaust gases, except for the
emission of CO2. The only certain way of cutting CO2 emissions is to encourage
fuel efficiency. Action is needed at international level and we will play our
full part.
Buses have an increasingly important part to play The deregulation of
long-distance coach services has led to a major expansion in reliable and cheap
services. Bus deregulation outside London has increased mileage by 16 per cent.
We now propose to take deregulation and privatisation further.
We will improve road transport by:
  Investing £6,300 million in our trunk road and motorway network over the next
  three years, concentrating particularly on bypasses. Some 40 new ones will be
  opened by 1993 on trunk roads alone.
  Increasing penalties for those convicted of drink driving.
  Installing cameras at dangerous road junctions to film those who drive through
  red traffic lights.
  Encouraging local councils, assisted by a special budget we have set aside, to
  introduce pedestrian priority areas and cycle lanes.
  Privatising the remaining 39 local authority bus companies.
  Deregulating buses in London and privatising the London Buses subsidiaries. A
  new London Bus Executive will be responsible for bus- stops, stands and
  stations and for contracting out socially necessary services. The
  concessionary fares scheme in London will continue.
  Changing the system under which motorway service areas are provided.
  Encouraging action internationally, and within our own motor industry, to
  promote more fuel-efficient vehicles.
AVIATION AND SHIPPING
More competition in aviation means more choice, better services and lower fares.
That is why we have been pressing within the EC for full liberalisation of
services. We also want to see more transatlantic flights, particularly to
regional airports. People in the regions should not have to travel to London in
order to fly to the United States. Direct flights would boost local economies
and apply downward pressure on fares. The key regional airports are still in
local authority ownership. They should be well placed to benefit from an
increase in the number of direct point-to-point flights. But if they are really
to grow and prosper, they need access to private capital, freed from the
constraints of public ownership.
Air safety cannot be compromised. Over the next five years the Civil Aviation
Authority will. invest £750 million in modernising its systems.
More can be done to cut some of the regulatory burdens our shipping industry
faces. We will ensure that the recommendations of the Government Industry Joint
Working Party are put into effect as rapidly as possible.
  We will further liberalise transatlantic air services and encourage more
  international flights to and from regional airports.
  We will encourage local authorities to sell their airports.
  We will reduce airport congestion by increasing the capacity of our air
  traffic control
  We will continue to campaign within the EC for further liberalisation,
  particularly of cabotage, so that there are more commercial opportunities for
  British companies.
LONDON'S TRANSPORT
A major programme of renewal and modernisation is transforming public transport
in London - including the biggest expansion of London's rail network since the
1930s.
The £750 million upgrading of the Central Line is already under way, to be
followed by a similar programme on the Northern Line; the Jubilee Line extension
and Crossrail will follow.
London Underground is planning to invest £3,500 million over the next three
years. It has introduced an ambitious Company Plan which will lead to better
service, cleaner trains and more staff at stations and on platforms. Their new
Charter will be published shortly
Responsibility for the Docklands Light Railway has been transferred to the
London Docklands Development Corporation. As its performance continues to
improve, we expect to see growing private sector interest in purchasing it
outright.
  We will seek to privatise the Docklands Light Railway during the lifetime of
  the next Parliament.
  The new Jubilee Line is being extended to Docklands and South East London and
  will be followed by the East-West Crossrail, linking Paddington to Liverpool
  Street. The Docklands Light Railway is being extended at an eventual cost of
  £800 million.
  London Underground's Charter will set out tougher new standards and what it
  will do to compensate passengers should it fail to meet those standards.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT
Local councillors - some 25,000 men and women throughout Britain - are
responsible for some of our most important public services. Since 1979 we have
sought to create an accountable local government system capable of delivering
high quality local services at a price that local people are prepared to pay.
Conservatives councils in shires, districts and cities have been at the
forefront of these reforms. In a responsive and efficient manner, they have
demonstrated how to deliver good services at an affordable price.
Over the past 13 years, we have:
  held down unjustified rises in the cost of local government;
  abolished the power of local councils to shift the burden of taxation on to
  local business, for the first time limiting the overall rise in business rates
  to no more than the rate of inflation;
  abolished an expensive and bureaucratic layer of government in London and
  other big cities;
  developed the local authority role from direct provider to effective enabler,
  encouraging many tenants to buy their own homes, allowing schools the freedom
  to manage their own affairs and improving the quality of local services by
  allowing private business to compete for contracts.
Labour threaten all these reforms. They would 'uncap' local spending, leading to
higher local and national taxes. They would 'uncap' business rates, threatening
a return to the 1980s when the English rate poundage rose 37 per cent more than
inflation. They would abolish the requirement on local authorities to seek value
for money through competitive tendering. They would remove the freedom of local
communities to preserve their grammar schools. They would introduce a new;
expensive layer of government bureaucracy at regional level. They would return
local government finance to the bad old days of domestic rates, with
unrestrained power for local councils to charge householders as much as they
like. And they would abolish the Audit Commission, which not only maintains the
probity of local government accounting, but also pioneered the drive for better
quality of service and value for money in local government.
We now propose further reforms in the structure, finance and accountability of
local government. In the meantime, we have transferred a further share of the
burden of financing local services to central government. Today, local community
chargepayers bear only a small proportion of the cost of local councils.
  We will set up a commission to examine, area by area, the appropriate local
  government arrangements in England. Local communities will be fully consulted
  and their loyalties and interests will be central to the commission s task in
  deciding whether in any area a single tier of local government could provide
  better accountability and greater efficiency.
  We are looking at ways in which the internal management of local authorities
  might become more effective.
  We are applying the principles of the Citizen's Charter to local government,
  requiring the publication of more information which will enable local people
  to judge the efficiency of their councils in providing services.
  We will continue to 'cap' local spending where necessary.
  As we announced in the Budget, no one's Uniform Business Rate will go up this
  year by more than the rate of inflation 4.1 per cent. And we have speeded up
  the benefits of revaluation for those businesses who gain from it.
  In future years, we will maintain our pledge to prevent UBR poundage rising by
  more than inflation.
  We will replace the Community Charge with a new Council Tax in April 1993. The
  Council Tax will be simple and straightforward to administer. It will be fair
  and will rightly reflect both the value of the property and the number of
  adults who live in it.
  Single householders, who suffered under the rates, will receive a 25 per cent
  discount. By grouping properties into a limited number of bands, the Council
  Tax also avoids the punitive bills which would be imposed by an unfettered
  rating system of the kind proposed by Labour. Students and people on low
  incomes will not have to pay.
CITIES
We take pride in our cities. Right across Britain they have been given a new
lease of life. From London to Glasgow; from Cardiff to Newcastle, historic
buildings have been restored and areas which had been run down have been
transformed. The £4,000 million Action for Cities programme underlines the
Conservative commitment to our inner cities and the people who live there. It
highlights our determination to spread opportunity as widely as possible. We
want all our people to share in growing prosperity and to have a stake in the
country's future. Much has been achieved in recent years. The Urban Development
Corporations and the wide range of central government grants have helped to
regenerate many of our inner city areas. But more remains to be done.
The best way to restore the spirit of enterprise which first made our cities
great is for local people, the private sector, the voluntary sector and local
and central government, to work together in partnership. That is the principle
which lies behind City Challenge. Its new approach of competitive bidding has
already galvanized towns and cities into bringing forward imaginative proposals
for regeneration. It has improved co-ordination, secured better value for money
and encouraged programmes which tackle problems on a number of fronts.
  We will continue to extend City Challenge and allocate a greater proportion of
  resources by competitive bidding.
  We will support Urban Development Corporations in their critical task of urban
  regeneration.
  We will bring together resources targeted inner city programmes into a single
  budget. This will mean that funding will go where it is most needed locally
  rather than according to a set of priorities determined in Whitehall.
  We will strengthen the machinery for co ordination in the regions. New,
  integrated regional offices of the appropriate Whitehall departments will be
  established so that business and local government will have only one port of
  call.
  We will establish a new Urban Regeneration Agency to pull together our efforts
  to clear up and develop derelict land, helping to bring it back into
  commercial use and provide new opportunities for local people.
Working in the urban areas, the URA will administer much of the Urban programme
of the Department of the Environment. It will have a dual function. First,
outside the existing UDC areas, it will reclaim derelict land, assembling
suitable sites for redevelopment using vesting or compulsory purchase powers
where necessary Second, it will itself be able to develop land in partnership
with the private sector. This represents a major step forward in unlocking the
commercial potential of our inner cities and of breathing new life into areas
which may have been derelict for many years.
But our focus is not just on physical regeneration. We want to see more
opportunities for training, more encouragement to enterprise, better education
and more measures to tackle drugs and crime.
Encouraging enterprise, improving the environment and providing new
opportunities for the unemployed are central to our inner city policies.
Remotivating individuals and providing the right conditions for business are the
only ways to make lasting change.
  We will offer the Loan Guarantee Scheme for small firms on more generous terms
  in inner city areas. The scheme will be extended from Task Force areas to
  include successful City Challenge bidders.
  We will make more people eligible for our successful Job Interview Guarantee
  Scheme, which links unemployed people with local lobs.
  We will carry out pilot projects for the 'foyer' concept, whereby young people
  are given a place in a hostel if in exchange they give a commitment to train
  and look for work.
  We will pilot a number of 'back to work' bonus schemes in inner city areas for
  the long-term unemployed.
  We will extend customised training under the Job Link programme to include
  City Challenge areas.
  We will make inner city Task Force and City Challenge areas eligible for
  regional innovation grants.
We are also determined to raise standards in our inner city schools, to crack
down on truancy, and to help prepare young people for the world of work.
The City Technology Colleges show what can be done. They are overwhelmingly
popular with parents and pupils and are doing much to raise standards for
children of all abilities in the inner cities.
Under the Citizen's Charter, we shall soon be able to identify much more
precisely than ever before those schools which are delivering unacceptably low
standards. So will parents. We will publish test results, exam results and
truancy rates and ensure that there is regular independent inspection. This will
enable us to put the spotlight on those inner city LEAs and schools which are
failing their pupils.
  We will continue to seek opportunities to open new CTCs in deprived inner city
  areas.
  We will ensure that more schools, especially in the inner cities, have the
  opportunity to develop their technological expertise.
Tackling crime and the fear of crime forms a vital part of the strategy to make
our inner cities better places to live and work. The Safer Cities initiative,
launched in 1988, has successfully brought together local groups and agencies to
tackle crime in some of our worst affected urban areas. Twenty schemes are
already in operation.
  We will double the number of Safer Cities Schemes to cover 40 urban areas.
LONDON
London is a magnet to visitors and business from across the world. Since 1979 we
have invested heavily to secure that status. Billions of pounds have gone into
improving air, rail and underground links. We will continue that programme of
modernisation. We are determined to sustain into the next century London's
special position as one of the world's leading capital cities. We reject
Labour's plan to recreate a bureaucratic and wasteful GLC. Instead, as part of
our Millennium programme, we will launch a London 2000 initiative. The Secretary
of State for the Environment will convene a new private sector forum to promote
London internationally as a business, tourist and cultural centre. The Secretary
of State will also chair a new Cabinet sub-committee to bring together Ministers
from all key departments and co-ordinate policy for the further improvement of
London. A single Minister will be given responsibility for co-ordinating
London's transport services. London's place as a world centre for financial and
insurance services is pre-eminent; we intend to keep it that way And we will
support the vigorous cultural life of the capital, which has seen new galleries,
theatres and museums opening over the last decade.
  We will launch a London 2000 initiative.
  We will convene a new private sector forum to promote London's position
  internationally.
  We will establish a new Cabinet sub committee to co-ordinate policy on London.

  We will give a single Transport Minister responsibility for services in
  London. He will chair a new Transport Working Group which will bring together
  public transport operators from both public and private sectors - to discuss
  transport issues in London.
THE COUNTRYSIDE
We have always cared for the countryside. We support its major industries and
way of life, while recognising the place it holds in the hearts of those who
live in towns.
We want to protect our most beautiful landscapes, conserve the abundance and
variety of our wildlife and habitats, promote access and public enjoyment of the
countryside, and encourage public participation in caring for the countryside.
But the countryside is more than just a pretty picture. It is a place where
people live and work, as they have done in the past and will do in the future.
In providing our public services, we will continue to recognise the particular
needs of people who live in the countryside.
  We will continue to promote a diverse rural economy, balancing the need for
  jobs, housing and services in rural areas with protection of the rural
  environment.
AGRICULTURE
Centuries of farming have shaped our countryside. Now farming is at a
crossroads, both here and in the rest of the European Community World-wide
pressure to reduce protectionist measures, and the need to contain the cost of
the Common Agricultural Policy, mean that farmers will face reduced support and
increased competition.
We believe that farming in the UK can meet these challenges. But many farmers
will need help to adapt to the new conditions, and we will continue to provide
assistance.
It will become increasingly important for farmers to obtain a greater proportion
of their income from the market. We will encourage farmers, retailers and
manufacturers to work together to increase our share of the European food
market.
We are committed to reducing the burden of regulation on business in general,
and farming in particular. We will not accept UK farmers being put at a
disadvantage by EC laws being applied differently in other countries.
Responsible farmers have always combined efficient farming with care for the
countryside. We will continue to encourage this approach through schemes to
protect landscape and habitats of special importance. We will also maintain
direct support for farming in the Less Favoured Areas in ways which encourage
good environmental practice
  We will seek a reform of the CAP which brings agriculture closer to the
  market; reduces the costs to taxpayers and consumers; is implemented at a pace
  which the industry can bear; affects all Community farmers equitably,
  regardless of size or location; and recognises the importance of environmental
  protection.
  We will build on the producer marketing initiatives which we have already
  launched, including the Group Marketing Grant.
  We will assist the Milk Marketing Board's move to a new structure which will
  be better able to protect the interests of producers and consumers in the
  Single Market.
  We will publish target response times for grant and licence applications made
  to the Ministry of Agriculture.
  We will take forward proposals for radical liberalisation of the agricultural
  tenancy laws in order to make more land available for rent, especially for new
  entrants.
  We will enforce effective pollution control regulations while helping farmers
  to meet the high standards required.
  We will press for an agreement in the EC's Agricultural Council which will
  allow us to provide financial encouragement for organic agriculture.
FORESTRY
Forestry is a traditional rural industry, which also affects the landscape, and
gives pleasure to millions of people. The needs of a successful industry,
landscape conservation, and public access must all be accommodated; and we will
reorganise the Forestry Commission to reflect these objectives more effectively.

  We will plant a new national forest in the Midlands and community forests
  elsewhere.
  We will review the effectiveness of the current incentives for forestry
  investment.
  We will produce guidance on the preparation of local Indicative Forestry
  Strategies designed to encourage new woodlands, while steering planting away
  from sensitive areas.
FISHING
Fishing is a vital industry in many parts of our islands. Many fishermen have
done well in recent years but they now face great pressure on the fish stocks.
This means that fishing quotas are likely to fall in coming years in order to
preserve the long-term future of the fisheries. We will continue to work for the
profitable and sustainable future of our fishing fleet.
  We are determined to see that the renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy
  protects the interests of UK fishermen and retains our share of the
  Community's fishing opportunities.
  We will introduce a balanced package of measures, including decommissioning
  and controls on fishing activity, to conserve fish and safeguard the future of
  the industry.
RURAL JOBS AND SERVICES
Changes in agriculture and other traditional industries will affect employment
opportunities in the countryside. We will continue to target help through the
Rural Development Commission, and ask the RDC to review the Rural Development
Areas to ensure that its efforts are targeted on the areas of most need. We are
committed to developing tourism in ways which provide all-year-round jobs and
bring benefit to less well-known parts of our countryside, without damaging the
environment. We have recently published new planning policy guidance which makes
it clear how the countryside can benefit from new businesses and jobs, if the
location and design of development are handled with sensitivity
In local government, many of our shire counties and districts have led the way
in raising the quality of public service. Local post offices, local transport
and local schools all have an important role to play in sustaining rural life.
  We will consult on our recently published draft planning policy guidance
  designed to provide a clear framework for decisions on developments to aid
  tourism.
  We will widen the availability of the Rural Development Commission's
  successful Redundant Buildings Grant Scheme, and strengthen other RDC
  programmes.
  We will maintain our special programmes to promote affordable homes in rural
  areas.
  We are fully committed to maintaining a national network of post offices.
  We will continue to assist local authorities who want to subsidise rural
  transport.
  We will enable village schools that wish to apply for Grant-Maintained status
  to do so in small groups, thus enabling them to share management tasks while
  still enjoying the benefits of independence.
  The expansion of GP fund-holding will bring particular benefits to rural areas
  because of the convenience of different services - such as physiotherapy and
  consultant appointments - being offered in the GP's surgery.
CARING FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE
Some of our finest landscapes are designated as National Parks. All National
Park authorities will become independent Boards, which will make it easier for
them to carry out their tasks effectively The New Forest will be given a
statutory status which will give it as great a level of protection as any
National Park.
Last summer the Government launched an experiment in Countryside Stewardship'.
This aims to conserve, enhance and re-create fine landscapes so that they may be
enjoyed and appreciated by the public. The response from farmers, landowners and
environmental bodies has been very positive. We therefore propose to expand the
scheme and to introduce a new scheme to preserve hedgerows - a much valued
feature of the English landscape, and a haven for wildlife.
The Government endorsed and supported the Countryside Commission's target
designed to bring 120,000 miles of rights of way into good order by the end of
the century.
At parish level, individuals can work together either to safeguard the character
of their local village, or to improve its appearance. Local action can also
preserve local wildlife and habitats. Under the Rural Environmental Action
Scheme, grants of up to £2,000 per project will be available to support local
environmental action.
The Government is keen to promote the fullest possible use of inland waterways
for leisure, recreation and amenity, in the regeneration of inner cities and for
freight transport where appropriate. But we recognise that the various uses of
canals and rivers must be properly managed to protect the character and
environment of the waterways.
  We will expand the Countryside Stewardship Scheme to cover the conservation of
  historic landscapes, meadows, pasture and hedgerows. Public access to
  qualifying schemes will be encouraged.
  We will introduce a Hedgerow Incentive Scheme to help preserve hedgerows of
  particular historic, landscape or wildlife importance.
  We will contribute to the Countryside Commission's new Parish Path Partnership
  designed to stimulate local maintenance and improvement schemes.
  We will continue to support the development and redevelopment of our canals,
  as well as enhancing the environmental standards of our waterways.
THE ENVIRONMENT
The Conservative Party's commitment to the environment is beyond doubt. Other
parties promise the earth. We have taken action - both nationally and
internationally - to preserve it.
Environmental protection can impose financial costs on producers, consumers and
taxpayers, so we must make sure the threat of damage is a real one. But we also
accept the precautionary principle - the need to act, where there is significant
risk of damage, before the scientific evidence is conclusive. And we recognise
that higher environmental standards can offer new opportunities for business.
We published the first comprehensive White Paper on the Environment in 1990. It
covered everything from the stratosphere to the street corner. We will continue
to publish annual progress reports.
This Conservative Government has taken a lead in working to protect the ozone
layer. We will strive to accelerate the eradication of ozone depleting
substances.
One of the most important issues facing all countries is the threat of global
warming. Effective action to combat global warming must be international action.
Again we have taken a lead. The Prime Minister was the first world leader to
announce his intention to attend the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this June.
We have said that we will consider stabilising our CO2 emissions earlier than
our existing conditional target of 2005. We have promised to provide new and
additional resources to help the developing countries to tackle their
environmental problems.
Within Britain, and ahead of other European countries, we have introduced the
concept of integrated pollution control.
We have set up, for the first time, powerful co-ordinating machinery within
Whitehall to ensure that environmental considerations are given due weight in
all decision-making.
We are committed to openness on environmental matters. We support the
establishment of a European Environment Agency to provide a Europe-wide
environmental database. We believe that the public should have access to
information held by the pollution control authorities. Public registers are now
provided by bodies such as the National Rivers Authority and Her Majesty's
Inspectorate of Pollution.
  We will establish a new Environment Agency which will bring together the
  functions of the National Rivers Authority, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of
  Pollution and the waste regulation functions of local authorities.
  The new EA will have a statutory duty to publish an annual State of the
  Environment report.
  Within the European Community we will press for the introduction of integrated
  pollution control on the UK model.
TOWARDS THE MILLENNIUM
A more prosperous Britain can afford to be ambitious. We can aspire to
excellence in the arts, broadcasting and sport. We can use our increased leisure
time, energy and money, to improve life for ourselves and our families. The
National Lottery we propose to introduce can be used to restore our heritage and
promote projects which will become a source of national pride.
National Lotteries have been found useful at several times in our history. The
British Museum was founded out of the proceeds of such a lottery. Fourteen years
ago, a Royal Commission recommended the creation of a National Lottery in
Britain to provide extra money for deserving causes. The case has become even
stronger as British people gain more opportunities to participate in foreign
lotteries - thus increasing the risk that funds which we could put to good use
in Britain will be diverted abroad.
We believe a well-run, carefully controlled form of national lottery would be
popular, while raising money for many good causes.
We will canvass views on how such a lottery should be run and controlled, and
how it would fit within the pattern of charitable fund-raising in Britain.
We believe that the funds generated by a National Lottery should be used to
enhance the life of our nation. People who enjoy the arts, sport, Britain's
heritage and fine countryside could all benefit from the proceeds from a
National Lottery. Charities, right across the country and covering such areas as
medical research, will also be potential beneficiaries.
THE MILLENNIUM FUND
We will be consulting widely on the best way to distribute the proceeds of a
lottery. But we have decided that part of the proceeds should be put aside, year
by year, into a Millennium Fund specifically dedicated to projects which will
commemorate the start of the twenty-first century and will be enjoyed by future
generations.
  We therefore propose to introduce a National Lottery from 1994, which would
  help provide funds for a number of good causes in the artistic, sporting,
  heritage and charitable fields - and from which some funds would be put aside
  for a Millennium Fund.
The Millennium Fund could be used, for example:
  To restore the fabric of our nation: our great inheritance of buildings which
  symbolise and enrich our national life.
  To help endow our cities and regions with facilities to enhance the
  celebration of United Kingdom 2000, such as the sporting facilities Manchester
  would need to host the 2000 Olympics.
  To help another major city - chosen by competition - to hold an international
  trade fair designed to be a showcase of British innovation for the
  twenty-first century.
  To enable voluntary groups and local communities to bid for funding for their
  own Millennium projects for local restoration schemes, or for improving the
  amenities of canals and rivers, as a source of enjoyment for local people and
  a habitat for wildlife.
  To provide Millennium bursaries for young people (and newly retired people)
  offering their time, energy and commitment to schemes designed to change the
  face of the United Kingdom by the year 2000.
THE ARTS
Britain has a great artistic heritage and a lively contemporary arts scene. The
arts have flourished in recent years, with growing attendance at theatre, opera,
dance and arts festivals.
We have supported this by increasing the public funding of the arts, by 60 per
cent in real terms since 1979, and introducing new incentives to personal
giving. The arts have also forged new partnerships with local authorities,
businesses and private patrons. Business sponsorship in particular has expanded
hugely.
We have set up new Regional Arts Boards and supported the Scottish and Welsh
Arts Councils in order to diversify and enrich cultural life throughout the
country.
We have financed the European Arts Festival to be held throughout Britain during
our Presidency of the Community in the second half of this year, as well as the
first National Music Day in June.
In this year's Budget, we announced further tax relief on film-making in this
country. Our aim is to make the performing arts, museums and our heritage
accessible to all. We will encourage the young to become involved and will
facilitate access for the disabled.
  The National Lottery will provide a new source of finance for the arts.
  We will maintain support for the arts and continue to develop schemes for
  greater sponsorship in co-operation with business and private individuals.
  We will re-examine the role of the Arts Council, as many of its functions are
  now carried out regionally.
  We will continue our support of libraries as educational, cultural and
  community centres, and urge local authorities to keep up standards. We will
  complete the new British Library building for which we have provided £450
  million.
SPORT
Success in sport is a source of national pride. Enjoyment of sport can enrich
every life. We have given strong support to the Sports Council and its efforts
to raise participation in sport. We actively support Manchester's bid to bring
the Olympic Games to Britain.
We want to restore the good image of football. Tough action has cut down
football hooliganism. We have helped to establish the Football Trust, which now
devotes £20 million a year to improving the safety of grounds.
Under the National Curriculum all primary and secondary age pupils will follow a
course of PE. All pupils will be taught to swim by the age of 11.
We will continue to encourage private sector sponsorship of sport. We will
encourage more effective use of local sport and leisure facilities through
compulsory competitive tendering. We want to see more dual use of school playing
fields and halls and will give schools more freedom in their management.
We are asking Local Education Authorities not to make sales of school playing
fields in future unless there is no evidence of long-term need.
  Sport, too, will benefit from the resources generated by the National Lottery
  We will actively support Britain's bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games in
  Manchester. We will provide £55 million towards the preparation of the site
  and key facilities in the first stage of the bid, and we will ensure that the
  project, whether successful or not, contributes to the effective regeneration
  of East Manchester.
  We will set up a new Business Sponsorship for Sport scheme. This is expected
  to raise £6 million in its first year to support local and youth sport.
OUR HERITAGE
Public interest and involvement in Britain's heritage has never been greater. We
have created in the past decade English Heritage and the National Heritage
Memorial Fund to give greater focus and drive to the Government's policies. The
National Trust and private owners take a leading part in preserving our almost
unrivalled heritage. Government will work in partnership to secure our heritage
for the benefit of future generations.
Our cathedrals are among our national glories. We therefore launched the
Cathedral Repair Grant Scheme in April 1991, providing £11.5 million over three
years.
We have increased, to £12 million, the grant to the NHMF for the purchase of
historic properties, objects and collections. The Government also provides help
to private owners through English Heritage repair grants, and tax relief in
return for commitments on upkeep and public access.
We want to preserve the special character of our old town and city centres. We
will encourage councils to ensure that new developments are in character with
the past; to maintain buildings of importance to the character of towns and
cities; to limit unnecessary street furniture and signs; and to plant trees and
preserve historic patterns and open spaces.
  The National Lottery will also provide funds for the preservation of our
  heritage.
  We will continue to provide substantial financial assistance for the
  protection and preservation of the heritage.
  Together with the heritage agencies, we will work to make heritage sites
  accessible to the public.
BROADCASTING
We are proud of our record of extending choice, encouraging new producers and
maintaining high standards in broadcasting. We opened the way to the setting-up
of Channel 4, independent radio, satellite television and multi-channel cable TV
networks. The 1990 Broadcasting Act means that three new independent radio
services and a fifth television channel will be set up during the next
Parliament.
Over two million homes already receive satellite TV We have now licensed well
over a hundred cable TV networks and this new industry expects to invest £3,000
million over the next five years. In coming years, British viewers will have an
increasing choice of channels and programmes. The new and sophisticated cable
networks will open the way not only to new telecommunication services, but also
to the spread of emerging technologies such as high definition television.
We attach great importance to the work of the Broadcasting Standards Council,
which we set up under the 1990 Act. All television and radio companies accept
the need to maintain standards of taste and decency in their treatment of sex
and violence and their use of bad language.
The European Community regulates standards in satellite broadcasts originating
from each Member State. We were one of the first countries to ratify a new
Council of Europe convention applying similar rules to all its Member States. We
also, in the Broadcasting Act, brought in sanctions against the transmission of
offensive satellite broadcasts from abroad, and made it an offence for
advertisers and equipment suppliers to support such programmes.
Independent television producers are benefiting from the requirement put on the
BBC and ITV to commission a quarter of all their programmes, excluding the news,
from outsiders. There are now great opportunities for independent producers to
sell their programmes to new television channels and international markets, and
there is much greater choice for viewers as a result.
In 1996, the BBC's Charter comes up for renewal. This will be considered against
the background of the much more varied and competitive broadcasting environment
which our policies have created. It is important that there should be a wide
public debate about the future direction the BBC should take.
  We will back the work of the Broadcasting Standards Council and remain
  vigilant about ensuring high standards in satellite broadcasts from abroad.
  We will publish a discussion paper on the future of the BBC recognising its
  special responsibilities for providing public service broadcasting.
A UNITED KINGDOM
The United Kingdom is far greater than the sum of its parts. Over many centuries
its nations have worked, and frequently fought, side by side. Together, we have
made a unique mark on history Together, we hold a special place in international
affairs. To break up the Union now would diminish our influence for good in the
world, just at the time when it is most needed.
Nationalist plans for independence are a recipe for weakness and isolation.
Higher taxes and political uncertainty would deter investment and destroy jobs.
The costly Labour and Liberal devolution proposals for Scotland and Wales have
the same drawbacks. They do not intend to bring about separation, but run that
risk. They could feed, but not resolve, grievances that arise in different parts
of Britain. They would deprive Scotland and Wales of their rightful seats in the
United Kingdom Cabinet, seats the Conservatives are determined to preserve. We
believe strongly that we should go on working together in full partnership in a
Union that has served every part of the United Kingdom well.
The plans for devolution put forward by the other parties would have a grave
impact not just on Scotland and Wales, but also on England. They propose new and
costly regional assemblies in England, for which there is no demand. We will
oppose all such unnecessary layers of government.
The Union has brought us strength both economically and politically Yet it has
preserved the historic and cultural diversity of our islands. Our constitution
is flexible, fair and tolerant. It has made this country one of the best places
in which to live, work and bring up our children. These benefits cannot be
tossed away lightly We will fight to preserve the Union, a promise which only
the Conservatives can give at this election.
SCOTLAND
Scotland has achieved an economic and cultural regeneration over the past 13
years. The Scottish economy has responded vigorously to the policies we have
introduced to liberate enterprise, and many more people are now saving,
investing and owning their homes. The public services are better funded and more
efficient. There has been a flowering of Scottish culture.
Scotland enjoys a rich and distinct tradition and her own institutions, which we
have preserved and strengthened. Scotland has its own framework for the
encouragement of enterprise, investment and training; its own education system
which continues to excel, with more pupils leaving school better qualified and
more going on to further and higher education; its own health budgets which
deliver high standards of care; and its own glorious inheritance of buildings
and countryside.
A separate Manifesto for Scotland sets out our record in detail and our
proposals for building on these achievements. In this document, therefore, we
list only a selection.
  Business in Scotland has received a boost from our creation of Scottish
  Enterprise and the Local Enterprise Companies. We have formed Scottish Trade
  International to help our exporters, as Locate in Scotland does for inward
  investors. To assist business further, we will complete the harmonisation of
  business rates in Scotland with those in the rest of the country.
  The massive bureaucracies and layers of local government have few supporters
  in Scotland. We will continue to press local authorities to provide the value
  for money and the quality of services that people expect. We will press ahead
  with the reform of the current burdensome system of local government by
  introducing single tier councils throughout Scotland.
  We will continue to strengthen Scotland's education system for the benefit of
  parents, pupils and teachers. We will respond to the proposals of the Howie
  Committee to ensure that upper secondary education matches the best in Europe.
  We will continue to increase the number of places in higher and further
  education and will complete our reforms of the system.
  We will extend our reforms to improve NHS patient care in Scotland. Scotland
  has led the way in setting limits to waiting-times for operations and will now
  be reducing these further.
  We are creating a new body, Scottish Natural Heritage, with overall
  responsibility for conserving the natural environment. We will go further, and
  will create a Scottish Environmental Protection Agency to bring together
  powers to ensure the quality of our air, rivers and bathing waters.
WALES
Since 1979, the economy of Wales has changed spectacularly With only 5 per cent
of the United Kingdom's population, Wales has consistently enjoyed 20 per cent
of its inward investment. New industries have sprung up. Self-employment has
risen by two-thirds. Welsh manufacturing now has the highest productivity of any
part in the United Kingdom.
Land made derelict by old industries has been reclaimed on a massive scale. The
Cardiff Bay development and the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival are outstanding
examples, together with the Programme for the Valleys.
Since 1979, we have spent more than £3,000 million on roads in Wales. Spending
on health has increased by 60 per cent in real terms since 1979. We have spent
more than £5 million on our radical Waiting Times Initiative, leading to the
treatment of 35,000 extra patients. In school we are spending nearly half as
much again, in real terms per pupil, as in 1979. And there has been an enormous
expansion in the training budget.
More Welsh homes - 72 per cent - are owned by those who live in them than in the
United Kingdom as a whole. Since the 'Right to Buy' was introduced in 1980, we
have enabled almost 90,000 council and housing association tenants to buy their
own homes.
A separate Manifesto, in both English and Welsh, sets out our full programme for
building on these achievements for Wales.
  We will set up a Welsh Economic Council to bring together the various bodies
  with interests in inward investment, tourism and small business to advise the
  Secretary of State.
  We aim to remove all significant dereliction from Wales by the end of the new
  Parliament.
  We will promote the work of the Countryside Council for Wales, in order to
  protect the countryside and those who earn their livelihood there.
  We will give further resources to our Rural Initiative. And we will continue
  to support hill farmers through the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances.
  We will continue to invest heavily in road improvements, including the second
  Severn Bridge, completing the M4 in South Wales and the M5 in North Wales.
  We will continue with our record hospital building programme.
  We will continue to offer generous funding for Housing for Wales and
  concentrate our efforts on the special needs of rural Wales. All major
  publicly funded housing developments will make adequate provision for the less
  well off.
  We will introduce a new Welsh Language Act.
  We will publish a White Paper on local government reform this autumn with a
  view to establishing unitary authorities, based on the historic counties and
  county boroughs. We will ensure a full role for Community Councils under these
  arrangements.
NORTHERN IRELAND
We have upheld our pledge that Northern Ireland will remain an integral part of
the United Kingdom in accordance with the democratically expressed wishes of the
majority of the people who live there. It is a pledge that only the Conservative
and Unionist Party can give. Conservative candidates are standing in our name
and in that cause.
Our overriding objective in Northern Ireland is to eliminate the evil of
terrorism. This requires progress in four areas: security, economic, social and
political. The security forces in Northern Ireland perform their duties with
courage and professionalism. They are entitled to expect all the necessary
encouragement, and legal and material support from the Government. Under the
Conservatives, the strength of the RUC has been increased, while the Emergency
Provisions Act 1991 contains new powers to combat terrorist funding.
Northern Ireland is sharing in the economic transformation of the United Kingdom
as a result of Conservative policies. Belfast is attracting significant new
private investment. Harland and Wolff and Shorts have been successfully
privatised. Major work is also under way to regenerate Londonderry and many of
Ulster's smaller towns. We will continue to pursue policies to encourage
enterprise and bring new jobs - by contrast with Labour, whose plan for a
national minimum wage would hit the Province particularly hard.
In the new Parliament we will continue to seek to re-establish stable
institutions of Government in Northern Ireland, so that powers currently
exercised by Ministers in the Northern Ireland Office can be returned to
locally-elected politicians.
  We will always give the security forces our full backing within the rule of
  the law, and - against Labour opposition - ensure that they have the special
  powers they need to protect the whole community from violence.
  We will complete the privatisation of Northern Ireland Electricity, transfer
  the water and sewage services to the private sector, and examine ways of
  bringing private sector skills into the management of Northern Ireland
  Railways.
  We will continue to pursue policies designed to alleviate social needs, to
  promote equity of treatment and to widen the sense of common purpose which is
  growing in the Province.
  We will build on the close security co operation that has been established
  with the Republic of Ireland under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.
  We will continue to work strenuously for a political agreement which is
  acceptable to all the parties involved in the talks which the Secretary of
  State has had during the past year with the main constitutional parties in
  Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Ireland. They have
  provided a firm basis for political progress in Ulster, and for building new
  relationships both between Northern Ireland and the Republic, and in these
  islands as a whole.
YOUR CHOICE AT THIS ELECTION
This Election is about the future. Your future. Britain's future. Our future
role in the world. This is a time to go forward with conviction and confidence,
not to go back to the failure and bitter controversies of the past.
It is difficult to remember the Britain we were elected to transform in 1979.
The country we did transform.
It was a depressed and divided country, accustomed to failure and suspicious of
change.
During the succeeding Parliaments, we have curbed inflation, reformed trade
union law; encouraged enterprise, cut taxes, modernised our education and
training, improved the management of our health service, given more help to the
needy, extended ownership, helped through our vigilance to end the Cold War,
widened our influence in Europe, and earned the respect of the world.
A decade of success ended with the problems of recession - a world recession. We
know how tough it has been for many but we are poised to move forward again,
lacking only the spark of confidence with which a Conservative victory would
ignite recovery.
THE CHALLENGE AHEAD
The challenges of the 1990s demand a responsible and sure-footed government
which understands the nature of the achievements of the 1980s and is ready to
build successfully on them. A government committed to the principles of choice,
ownership, responsibility and opportunity; committed to low inflation and low
taxes; committed to better quality and value in our public services; committed
to strong defences. Labour cannot provide that leadership. They lack experience,
principle and vision.
With Socialism everywhere in rout or retreat, it is unclear what the Labour
Party stands for. For public consumption, Labour leaders purport to have
jettisoned the principles of a life-time. But how much can they be trusted? How
genuine is the conversion and what do they actually believe?
It is clear only that Labour would threaten our achievements, undo our reforms
and hamstring Britain. They would turn the clock back to policies that
impoverished and divided our country. Socialism here and abroad is the regret of
yesterday not the hope of tomorrow.
ONLY THE BEST FOR BRITAIN
We believe that only the best is good enough for Britain, and that the best will
only be accomplished if we give the British people the freedom and the
opportunity they need to succeed.
We have a new leader, proven in office, and a new agenda - yet a tried set of
principles. Those principles reflect our conviction that Britain has done best
when the people of Britain have been given the personal incentive to succeed.
National success has not been primarily the result of accidents of geography,
landscape and natural resources. Nor has it been the result of government action
and state control. Success has been won when we have given our people their
head: when their natural skills, talents, energy; thrift and inventiveness have
been released, not suppressed. That was true when this century began; it is
still true as this century draws to its close.
Britain should approach the Millennium with head and spirits high, with a strong
economy, with a high standard of living, with generously endowed and well
managed public services, and with secure defences. We want Britain to be an
example to the world of how a free people can make the very best of their
destiny. That prospect is within the grasp of us all. We must now make it
happen.
The prize is great, the hope invigorating, the dream attainable. We want, with
you, to make the dream a reality. A Conservative Government will help you to
achieve the very best. The very best future for Britain.

British Conservative Party: Manifesto for 1997 General ElectionYOU CAN ONLY BE
SURE WITH THE CONSERVATIVES
The Conservative Manifesto 1997


Foreword
The Conservative administrations elected since 1979 are among the most
successful in British peacetime history. A country once the sick man of Europe
has become its most successful economy. A country once brought to its knees by
over-mighty trade unions now has industrial peace. Abroad, the cold war has been
won; at home, the rule of law has been restored. The enterprising virtues of the
British people have been liberated from the dead hand of the state. There can be
no doubt that we have created a better Britain.
Why, then, do we still need a Conservative Government? Because resting on what
we have achieved is not enough. To stand still is to fall back. Our goal must be
for Britain to be the best place in the world to live.
We live in a tougher, more uncertain world. A fast-moving global free market is
emerging. New economic powers are rising in the East. Family life and social
attitudes are changing. Europe is adjusting to the end of communism. The
European social model is failing. The nation state is under threat. We must
respond to these challenges.
We have turned around our economic fortunes. We have fewer people out of work
and more in work than any other major European economy. British people now have
the opportunity of a prosperous future. But that prosperity cannot be taken for
granted. We have to compete to win. That means a constant fight to keep tight
control over public spending and enable Britain to remain the lowest taxed major
economy in Europe. It means a continuing fight to keep burdens off business,
maintaining our opt-out of the European Social Chapter. If we relax for one
moment, our hard won success will slip away again.
We have strengthened choice and personal ownership for families, and rolled back
the state from areas where it was interfering unnecessarily in our lives. But we
now have the opportunity to achieve a massive expansion in wealth and ownership
so that more families can enjoy the self-respect and independence that comes
with being self-sufficient from the state. Our far-reaching proposals for
personal pension funds are central to achieving this - so too are our plans to
increase support for the family in our tax system. Our aim is to spread
opportunity for all to succeed, whoever they are and wherever they come from,
provided they are prepared to work hard. To turn the ""have nots"" into the
""haves"". To support the family in providing security and stability.
We have modernised and reformed many of the areas where the state still has a
vital role. But we now have to build on these reforms to deliver even better
services. We must continue providing the resources to invest in our modernised
health service. We can now provide parents with a hard-edged guarantee of
standards in schools. We need also to widen choice in areas where state
bureaucracy has constrained it.
We have pioneered new ways of building partnerships that engage the private
sector in areas previously dependent on the public purse. We now need to capture
private sector investment on a massive scale to regenerate our cities, transform
our crumbling local authority housing estates and modernise other public assets.

The only way to secure this future of opportunity is to stick with the
Conservative programme of continuing reform. Now would be the worst possible
moment to abandon the pathway to prosperity on which we are set. We must keep up
the momentum.
At the same time we must maintain the security that a stable nation provides in
an uncertain, fast-changing world. We must protect our constitution and unity as
a nation from those who threaten it with unnecessary and dangerous change. And
we must stand up for our interests in shaping a free-market Europe of sovereign
nation states.
There is, of course, an alternative on offer: to load costs on business while
calling it ""stakeholding""; to increase the role of the state, while calling it
""the community""; to succumb to a centralised Europe while calling it ""not being
isolated""; to break up our country while calling it ""devolution"".
To risk this alternative would be a disaster for our country. We have come a
very long way. We must be sure that we do not throw away what we have gained, or
lose the opportunities we have earned.

Our Record
  The UK is on course to grow faster than both France and Germany for the sixth
  successive year in 1998 - a post-war record.
  Inflation has now been below 4% for well over 4 years, the longest period of
  low inflation for almost half a century.
  Mortgage rates are at their lowest levels for 30 years.
  Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level for 6 years. We now have a lower
  unemployment rate than any other major European economy. Youth unemployment in
  Britain has fallen to less than 15% whereas by contrast, in France it has
  risen to 27% and in Italy to 33%.
  A higher proportion of our people are in work than in any other major European
  economy - 68% against a Continental average of 57%.
  The UK is the favourite location for inward investment into Europe, attracting
  around one third of inward investment into the European Union.
  We have the lowest tax burden of any major European economy, with the
  government taking almost 8% less of national income than the European average.

  Public borrowing has averaged 3.4% of GDP since 1919 compared with 6.8% (and a
  peak of 9.5%) under the last Labour Government. Our level of public debt is
  now one of the lowest in the European Union - whereas it was one of the
  highest in 1979.
  In 1994 the UK lost 300,000 working days through strikes, the lowest figure
  ever recorded; in 1979 the figure was 29,500,000: nearly 100 times that
  figure.
  Britain ranks fifth in the world in international trade, and exports more per
  head than America or Japan. Exports account for 28% of GDP as against 9% for
  Japan, 11 % for USA and 24% for Germany and France. Britain's current account
  is broadly in balance, reflecting our increased competitiveness and improved
  trading.



1. Doubling Living Standards
The free market is winning the battle of ideas the world over. From Russia to
Vietnam, from China to Romania, people are realising that the socialist model
has failed. This is not just an economic triumph. It is a triumph for human
freedom. Britain helped to secure it. We should take pride in it.
The spread of the free market heralds a new age of global competition. That
means new markets for British goods and services, but new competitors for
British companies as well.
If we try to protect ourselves from these challenges with more regulations,
public subsidies and a cosy dependence on government then Britain will fail. But
if we boldly embrace these new opportunities by pushing forward the economic
revolution we began in 1979, then we will enter the next millennium with
boundless prospects for growth and prosperity.
That choice - between stagnation and dynamism - is the choice which faces
Britain at this election. It is a stark choice between the British way - of
trusting the people and unleashing enterprise - and the failing social model,
practised on the continent, which the Labour Party wants to impose on us here
under the guise of ""stakeholding"".
Hard economic evidence shows how great is the divide between these two
strategies. Britain is now in its fifth year of growing faster than France or
Germany. Unemployment in Britain has fallen to less than two million, while it
rises across Europe. Britain attracts nearly forty per cent of all the American
and Japanese investment in Europe. Our aim now is to safeguard these
achievements and build on them, so Britain becomes the unrivalled Enterprise
Centre of Europe.

A Low Tax Economy
For enterprise to flourish, the state must get out of the way of the wealth
creators. We are the only party that can cut taxes because we are the only party
which is serious about controlling public spending. The choice between the two
economic philosophies is clean In the years before 1979, public spending in
Britain kept pace with the average for Europe as a whole. Since then, it has
continued rising on the continent, while we have restrained public spending
here. Now, public spending takes about 40% of our national income as against an
average of 50% on the continent. We have broken free from a trend in which the
rest of Europe is still trapped.
Conservative government will keep public spending under tight control and ensure
that it grows by less than the economy as a whole over the economic cycle. At
the same time we will continue to spend more on the services which matter most
to people - hospitals, schools and the police.
  Over the next parliament, we will achieve our goal for the government to spend
  less than 40% of our national income
That means we can reduce the amount government borrows too, and meet our aim of
moving towards a balanced budget in the medium term. Our plans show how we can
virtually eliminate public borrowing by the year 2000.
Thanks to our success in controlling public spending, Britain is now Europe's
low tax economy. This is one of the reasons why we are becoming the Enterprise
Centre of Europe.
  Our aim is to ensure Britain keeps the lowest tax burden of any major European
  economy.
In the election manifesto of 1992, we promised that ""We will make further
progress towards a basic income tax rate of 20p"". Since then, we have cut the
basic rate of income tax from 25p to 23p, and extended the 20p band so that over
a quarter of all taxpayers now only pay income tax at the 20p rate. Achieving
our public expenditure goals will mean we can sustain permanently low tax
levels.
  Over the next parliament, our aim will be to achieve our target of a 20p basic
  rate of income tax, while maintaining a maximum tax rate of no more than 40p.
Stable Prices
Inflation has to be kept firmly under control for an economy to thrive. Britain
is now enjoying the longest period of stable prices for almost fifty years. We
are on target to reach our goal of 2½% inflation this year.
Low inflation has delivered lower interest rates whilst preserving the value of
people's savings. Homeowners are now enjoying mortgage rates at the lowest
levels for 30 years.
It has taken tough decisions to break free from our reputation as a high
inflation economy. No Conservative government will jeopardise this achievement.
  During the next parliament, we will maintain an inflation target of 2½% or
  less.
Rising Living Standards
The only secure base for rising living standards is a strongly growing economy,
low levels of public spending and taxation, and stable prices. That is exactly
what Britain is achieving. People are reaping the rewards of their hard work as
their take home pay increases. Between 1974 and 1979, the take home pay for a
family on average earnings rose, in real terms, by just £1 a week in today's
prices. Since 1979 it has increased by £100 a week; this year alone it will
increase by £7 a week.
  The goal which we set ourselves in 1995 is to double living standards over 25
  years.
We are on course to achieve our goal.
2. Jobs and Business
Our priority is to create jobs. This is not just an economic priority, but also
a social and moral one. Jobs and enterprise are the best ways of tackling
poverty and deprivation.
Britain is succeeding. 900,000 jobs have been created over the past 4 years. By
contrast the European social model is stifling job creation on the continent by
imposing regulations and burdens on business. In the United Kingdom unemployment
is much lower than in the rest of Europe and falling whereas in Germany, France,
and Italy it has risen to its highest level for a generation. This is no
accident. It is because we have pursued very different policies from those on
the Continent.
Curbing the power of trade unions, opening up markets and cutting red tape, have
given us a low strike, low cost economy: and as a result Britain is the number
one location for foreign investment in Europe.
Never have such policies been so important. For the first time this century we
face a world full of capitalist competition. The only way Britain will be able
to compete and win in world markets is by sticking to the Conservative policies
that are delivering success. We can earn prosperity as one of the world's most
successful global trading nations. We should not risk this progress by adopting
the very policies that have made the continent uncompetitive and have increased
unemployment in Europe by 4.5 million over the past 5 years.

Small Businesses - Britain's Risk-takers
Governments do not create jobs. Businesses do. The source of tomorrow's jobs
will be small businesses, the seedcorn of Britain's prosperity. Over the last 15
years, small businesses have created over 2 million jobs. By the year 2000, over
half the workforce should be working in companies which employ fewer than 50
people. Back in 1979 only a third of the workforce did.
Entrepreneurs often risk everything when they set up their own business. We have
already helped them: raising the VAT threshold, cutting employer's national
insurance contributions, simplifying audit requirements and much more besides.
Now we intend to go further, tackling the remaining problems they face.
High taxes and rates deter enterprise. Our low tax structure has been crucial to
our industrial revival. We already have the lowest corporation tax of any major
industrialised country. As we want small businesses to flourish, we will go even
further.
  We will cut the small companies rate of corporation tax in line with personal
  taxation as we move towards a 20p basic rate
Investment and enterprise are deterred if the taxman takes too much of the
capital that is built up by a successful business. Capital is ever more mobile,
flying around the world to places where the tax on it is low: Britain must be
one of those places.
  We will continue to reduce the burden of capital gains tax and inheritance tax
  as it is prudent to do so.
One of the heaviest burdens small businesses face is business rates. At the
moment, this bears more heavily upon small businesses than large ones.
  In the next parliament, we will reform business rates to reduce the cost that
  falls upon small businesses.
No businessman has time to fill out reams of forms. We will continue to simplify
the administration of NICs and PAYE for small firms, allowing them to
concentrate on satisfying customers not bureaucrats. We are also tackling a
problem that hits small businesses particularly hard - the late payment of
bills. On top of our programme to ensure government departments and local
authorities pay on time we have legislated to require companies to publish their
payment policy and to report their record on how quickly they pay their bills to
small businesses.
We have already abolished over a thousand regulations. New regulations must only
be introduced if it is clear that their benefits exceed their costs and they do
not place an undue burden on a small firm.
  We will introduce ""sunset"" requirements into new regulations whenever
  appropriate so that they are automatically reviewed or dropped after a
  specific period.
Many businessmen suffer regulatory burdens imposed by local government and
quangos.
  We will therefore insist that the whole of the public sector adopts the same
  stringent rules that we require of central government in justifying the
  benefits of new regulations against their costs.
Reducing the Burden on Companies
Jobs depend on British firms winning orders: the difference between success or
failure can be wafer-thin. Any extra burden on business will destroy jobs.
Britain is enjoying more jobs and record investment, thanks to the competitive
edge we have over other European countries. We are a low cost economy But that
does not mean we are a low pay economy. Our competitive advantage comes from the
lower costs facing our businesses. It can be measured by the social costs an
employer has to pay on top of every £100 of wages: in Germany it is £31, in
France £41, but in Britain, it is only £15.
Many countries in Europe have tried to cocoon themselves from global competition
behind layers of red tape and regulation - such as the Social Chapter and a
national minimum wage. This provides a false sense of security, playing a cruel
trick on working people. It also excludes the unemployed from work. As companies
in the rest of Europe have grown more uncompetitive, employers have found it too
expensive to employ new workers, investment has gone elsewhere, and the dole
queues have lengthened. The European social model is not social and not a model
for us to follow. But if Britain signed up to the Social Chapter it would be
used to impose that model on us - destroying British jobs.
  No Conservative government will sign up to the Social Chapter or introduce a
  national minimum wage We will insist at the Intergovernmental Conference in
  Amsterdam that our opt-out is honoured and that Britain is exempted from the
  Working Time Directive: if old agreements are broken, we do not see how new
  ones can be made
We will resist the imposition of other social burdens on the work place through
a new European employment chapter.
Welfare into Work
Although governments cannot create jobs, they can help people train and find
work. We now have in place a battery of schemes working with Training and
Enterprise Councils to provide targeted help and training, including remedial
education in literacy and numeracy. We are also developing new incentives,
alongside Family Credit, to help people move off benefit into work.
We will always help those in genuine need: in return, the unemployed have a
responsibility to look for work and accept a reasonable offer That belief
underpins our new Jobseeker's Allowance which ensures that no-one can refuse
reasonable work opportunities and remain on benefit.

As unemployment falls, we want to focus on those who have been unemployed for
some time. At present, Project Work is helping 100,000 people who have been
unemployed for more than 2 years in cities around Britain. They are first given
help in finding a job - which includes giving employers incentives to take them
on. Those who do not find jobs are then required to work for a specific period
on a community project. This helps them regain work habits and ensures they are
available for work.
  As Project Work succeeds and demonstrates that its costs can be met by the
  savings from getting people into work, we will extend the programme to cover
  the long-term unemployed nationwide
  We will also develop an innovative ""Britain Works"" scheme which uses the
  experience and ingenuity of private and voluntary sectors to get people off
  welfare into work.
Britain has one of the most mobile economies in Europe. People move on, and up,
into better paid jobs more easily than on the continent.
The Information Society
Britain is at the forefront of creating tomorrow's information society Already
we have exposed domestic telecommunications to competition and stimulated
investment in cable and satellite entertainment systems. And by opening up
international telecommunications we will continue to encourage companies
worldwide to base their global operations here. We will make sure that the
digital revolution comes to Britain first.
We are launching an ambitious programme with industry to spread ""IT for All"",
giving every adult the opportunity to try out and learn about new IT services.
We will work with industry to ensure that all schools are connected to the
information superhighway.
  We will use the Millennium Lottery Fund to transform the computer facilities
  and information links available in schools, libraries, museums, voluntary
  organisations and other public places after the turn of the century.
This will give the public much wider access to information services in the years
ahead. We will also take advantage of information technology to transform the
way government provides services to the public.
We will keep Britain in the vanguard of new mobile service development -
including mobile telephone and information services - by introducing a pricing
system for the radio spectrum to achieve more efficient allocation of radio
frequencies.
We will maintain a strong, free and competitive broadcasting and press
environment at both national and local level, while continuing to be vigilant in
monitoring whether action is needed to curb breaches of standards, and prevent
unacceptable press intrusion.
Science
British science enjoys a worldwide reputation for excellence and
cost-effectiveness, which makes Britain an attractive base for many domestic and
overseas companies. We will continue to invest in science and target funds at
basic research, which would not otherwise be funded by industry. At the same
time we will provide an enterprising environment which encourages firms to
invest with confidence in applied science.
2020 Vision
There is no part of the globe which has not been reached by British enterprise
and British culture. We have always looked out beyond these shores, beyond this
continent. Our language, our heritage of international trading links, our
foreign investments - second only to America's - are historic strengths which
mean we are ideally placed to seize the opportunities of the global economy.
Thanks to Conservative policies of liberalisation and privatisation we are
strong in industries of the future such as telecommunications, financial
services, and information technology. These are the industries that will benefit
from opening up trade around the world. We will push for completion of the
European Single Market and continue to pursue the objective of transatlantic
free trade against the background of world trade liberalisation.
  Our aim is nothing less than tariff free trade across the globe by the year
  2020
Free competition is important for free markets. Companies should not make
agreements that restrict competition and hence result in poor value for
consumers. We have set out proposals to give companies greater protection
against price fixing, dumping, and other restrictive practices by larger
competitors.
  We will introduce a Competition Bill to take forward these proposals in the
  first session of the next parliament
We are committed to pushing forward our competitiveness agenda which is making
Britain the Enterprise Centre of Europe.



Opportunity and Ownership for Individuals and Families
Our Record - Opportunity
  The right to buy has allowed 1.5 million council tenants to become homeowners.
  There are over 4 million more homeowners today than in 1979.
  The Government has spent £6 billion through housing associations to provide
  homes for rent. Between 1992 and 1995 housing associations provided 178,000
  new lettings - 25,000 more than promised in the 1992 Manifesto.
  There are now around 10 million private shareholders, up from about 3 million
  at the time of the last Labour government. 2.5 million people now have tax
  free savings in PEP accounts, and 4.5 million in TESSAs.
  Since 1979, the success of private pension provision has raised the average
  income of pensioners by 60% more than inflation. Almost 90% of recently
  retired pensioners now have incomes over and above state benefits.
  Savings in private pension funds have increased to £650 billion -more than 4
  times the level in 1979. Their value is greater than the pension funds in all
  other EU countries added together.
  Over the period 1979 to 1995, education spending per pupil rose from £515 to
  £1,890 - an increase in real terms of 48%. Real spending on books and
  equipment per pupil rose 56%. Teachers' real pay rose 57%: from £270 per week
  in 1979 to £420 in 1995.
  In 1979, 40% of three and four year olds attended nursery school; in 1995 the
  figure was 59%. Our nursery vouchers now give this opportunity to every child.

  The proportion of sixteen year olds staying on in full-time education rose
  from 4 out of 10 in 1979 to 7 out of 10 in 1995.
  Almost 1 in 3 young people now go on to university, compared with 1 in 8 in
  1979.
  The proportion of adults with no academic qualifications has halved since 1979
  and the proportion of adults with a degree or equivalent has more than doubled
  rising from 5% to 12%.
3. Choice and Security for Families
The family is the most important institution in our lives. It offers security
and stability in a fast-changing world. But the family is undermined if
governments take decisions which families ought to take for themselves.
Self-reliance underpins freedom and choice.
Families are stronger if they have the money to look after themselves: that is
why we are shifting power and wealth back to working families and away from the
state. We have already achieved much - the average family's disposable income
has gone up by 40% since 1979. But we want to go further. The next Conservative
government intends to reform the tax system so that it gives substantially more
help to families.
We also want to encourage people to save so they have the security and
self-respect that comes from being able to rely on their own resources rather
than immediately turning to the state. We have already made much progress here
too with widening ownership of homes, pensions, and the new PEPs and TESSAs. We
now propose further radical measures for more saving for retirement.
Families and Tax
We believe families should be left with as much of their own money as possible.
They know better than politicians how to spend it. We have already cut the basic
rate of income tax from 33p to 23p, and our aim is to get it down to 20p,
benefitting 18 million taxpayers. We intend to do even more to help families in
particular
At the moment, if one spouse does not take paid work in order to look after
children or dependent relatives, they not only give up earnings but may also be
unable to benefit from their personal tax allowance. Yet this is the time at
which their income is often most stretched.
We believe our tax system should recognise and support the crucial role of
families in their caring responsibilities. We will give them that support.
  We will give priority to future reductions in personal taxation that help
  families looking after dependent children or relatives by allowing one
  partner's unused personal allowance to be transferred to a working spouse
  where they have these responsibilities.
This will provide a targeted reduction in the tax bill to those families who
need it most. Around 2 million one-taxpayer couples with dependent children, or
looking after elderly relatives and others needing care, would gain up to £17.50
a week - around £900 a year
Family Savings
In the old days people just depended on the weekly pay packet or money from the
state. But no job can be secure and the state cannot provide for every
eventuality. It is ownership which brings true security and genuine independence
from the state. That is why Conservatives have long dreamed of a property-owning
democracy. Now we are delivering it in practice. Home ownership is up by 4.7
million. 10 million people own a direct personal stake in our economy. 16
million are gaining shares in their building societies thanks to our
deregulation of them. We intend to carry forward our vision of a people's share.
This is a significant increase in personal security. It is the Conservative
vision of security through personal savings - not a socialist vision of security
through the state.
We want people to enjoy Britain's success - especially by owning shares in the
companies for which they work. We have already introduced a number of schemes to
encourage employee share ownership. To encourage a further expansion of worker
shares, our new Share Match Scheme will allow employees to be rewarded with
additional free shares if they acquire a stake in their company.
  Our goal is that by 2000, more than half of the employees of Britain's larger
  companies will own shares in those companies.
Four and a half million people now benefit from tax free TESSAs and 2.5 million
from PEP schemes to encourage the accumulation of long term saving. We will
continue to build on this success by exploring ways in which existing tax
exemptions for savings can be developed - allowing individuals to secure their
future and protect their families against unexpected contingencies.
  We will continue to raise the threshold for inheritance tax as it is prudent
  to do so.
People are not just saving for themselves but for their children and
grand-children. These savings should not be penalised by the tax system.
For many people their biggest asset is their pension. Thanks to the steps we
have already taken to encourage occupational and personal pensions, we now have
£650 billion invested in private pensions - more than the rest of the European
Union put together We now plan to build further on this achievement.
  We will make it easier for small employers to set up personal pension plans
  for groups of employees.
  We will create more flexibility for people who save in personal pension plans
  to continue investing in those schemes if they subsequently move to jobs with
  company pension schemes.
  We will also create flexibility for employees with savings in Additional
  Voluntary Contributions (AVC) schemes to take part of that pension earlier or
  later than their main company pension.
But we believe the time has now come to plan for another important step in
improving Britain's pension provision. Britain is already much better placed
than many other countries to afford state pensions in the future, but we want
even more people to be able to look forward to properly funded pension that
grows with the economy and is free from dependence on taxes paid by future
generations. We now propose a practical way of achieving a gradual
transformation of the state pension scheme.

  At the start of the next parliament we will set out proposals to provide all
  young people entering the workforce with a personal pension fund paid for
  through a rebate on their national insurance contributions. At retirement they
  would be entitled to the full pension earned by this accumulated investment.
  This could give them a pension significantly higher than they would currently
  receive from the state. But they will be guaranteed a pension at least equal
  to the current bask state pension, increased in line with inflation.
This will be one of the most significant improvements in the state pension
system since it was introduced.
Older people currently in the workforce would be unaffected - they will continue
to contribute as now and receive the normal state pension when they retire.
This policy would come into effect early in the new millennium. Gradual phasing
in of the new system over 40 years will make the impact on public finances
affordable. Even at its peak, the net revenue forgone will be only a fraction of
the savings from the recent Pensions Act. And eventually, the new policy will
produce massive public expenditure savings.
This far-sighted idea is in the best Conservative tradition. The growing wealth
of the nation will provide for the next generation through private funding,
underpinned by a state guarantee. British people will be able to look forward to
retirement with even greater confidence. And our young people will have a
pensions opportunity unrivalled in the world.
Support for Families
Conservatives believe that a healthy society encourages people to accept
responsibility for their own lives. A heavy-handed and intrusive state can do
enormous damage.
Some families need help to cope with their responsibilities. For them, Social
Services play a vital role. They help with children where parental care has
failed. They deliver an ever wider range of services to people with learning
difficulties or who are mentally ill. Our community care reforms have given them
a central role ensuring that elderly people get care of the highest quality: and
in their own homes where possible. We need to ensure that role is properly
fulfilled.
Early in the next Parliament we will introduce a Social Services Reform Bill
which will create a new statutory framework for social services. The Bill will
provide for greater openness and accountability in social services.
  We will provide new guidance to ensure social workers properly reflect the
  values of the community - focusing their efforts on those families who most
  need support, and minimising unnecessary interference. Social workers working
  with children will receive special training to cope with the often
  heart-rending cases they face.
  We will raise standards through a new regulatory framework which will apply
  the same standards in both the public and private sector.
  We will also remove the power of local authorities to operate care homes where
  this is in the best interests of the people for whom they are responsible.
We believe that families who use social services should be able to exercise
choice wherever practicable. We have given cash payments to disabled people to
purchase the services they need directly.
We also want new ways of reinforcing individual choice where possible. We will
therefore ensure no barriers stand in the way of local authorities wanting to
issue their users with vouchers to buy certain services.
  We will review the direct payment scheme, and provided it has been cost
  effective, we will extend it to other users of social services.
Above all, we want to help families to help themselves. Caring for older - or
disabled - relatives is one of the most natural human instincts. We recognise
the crucial and often demanding role carers play, and will help them more.
  We will introduce a Respite Care Programme. This will enable family members
  with heavy responsibilities caring for a relative to take a much needed break.
  We will also offer more practical advice for carers who want to go back to
  paid work.
But in some cases, elderly people need more care than their friends or relatives
can provide. Financing long term care worries many families. We will create an
imaginative, fair partnership between individuals and the public sector to
resolve this problem.
  In the first session of the next Parliament we will implement our partnership
  scheme for long term care, making it easier for people to afford the cost of
  care in old age without giving up their lifetime savings.
Good preparation for marriage can be an important aid to a successful family,
while timely help in meeting difficulties can often avoid family breakdown.
These are matters for voluntary effort, not the state, but we will continue to
support such effort.
We need to make sure efforts to help struggling families does not turn into
unnecessary meddling.
When the state goes too far, it is often the children who suffer They become
victims of the worst sort of political correctness.
  We will introduce legislation to remove unnecessary barriers to adoption and
  introduce new rules to make adoption from abroad more straightforward.
  We will also monitor the workings of the Children Act, and act if necessary to
  ensure it maintains a proper balance between the rights of children and the
  responsibilities of adults.
Social Services departments are now the fourth arm of the welfare state. Most
people will need them at some point in their lives. We will ensure that the
Conservative revolution in public services now reaches Social Services.
Disabled People
We have quadrupled real spending on long term sick and disabled people since
1979, to £22 billion.
We have introduced the Disability Discrimination Act. This is the first
legislation of its kind anywhere in Europe and it provides positive proof of our
commitment to disabled people. We will monitor it to ensure it continues to meet
its objectives.
We are also providing a continuing fund to enable the most severely disabled
people to stay in their own homes.
Security in Retirement
Pensioners continue to make a positive contribution to society in retirement.
They give more of their time in charitable work than any other age group. They
lift some of the pressures on their own families. They help keep our nation's
history and traditions alive.
They have paid their National Insurance contributions and taxes and rightly
expect us to continue to protect the value of the basic state pension against
price rises. We will do so. We will also ensure that less well off pensioners
continue to get extra help on top of the basic pension.
At the same time as protecting the state pension, our encouragement of private
pensions is already transforming the living standards of pensioners. The average
net income of pensioners has risen by 60% since 1979. This has been achieved by
our encouragement of saving for retirement.
The tax system must help pensioners who have saved. Our new lower 20p rate on
income from savings directly helps 1.7 million pensioners and the special age
allowances raise the point at which pensioners start to pay income tax.
A Better Social Security System
People in need can rely on our continuing support. To ensure that taxpayers are
willing to go on paying for that support, we have shaped a social security
system we can afford, taking a steadily declining share of our national income.
We are doing this by focusing benefits on those most in need, helping people off
welfare and into work, and curbing welfare fraud. These policies are underpinned
by our measures to help families help themselves.
Social Security must be there to help families, pensioners and people in need.
We will protect the value of Child Benefit and Family Credit which help with the
cost of bringing up children. This is our Family Benefits Guarantee.
We will bring the structure of benefits for lone parents into line with that for
two-parent families. We will continue to help lone parents obtain maintenance,
and assist with childcare in work: both these measures help lone parents obtain
work. We will pilot our ""Parent Plus"" Scheme that gives special help to lone
parents who want to work, and extend it if it proves successful.
Social Security fraud must be stamped out.
  We will intensify our current initiatives of inspections and checks, including
  more home visits, to crack down further on benefit cheats. We will introduce
  benefit cards across the country. We will establish a Benefit Fraud
  inspectorate to monitor local authorities' performance. We will also improve
  the sharing of information between government departments to catch more
  fraudulent claims.
To ensure as much of the Social Security budget as possible goes into benefits,
we will continue to improve the efficiency of administration, using the best mix
of public and private sector operations.
Housing
 Owning one's own home is an aim shared by millions of people. Over the last 18
years, the number of homeowners has increased by 4.7 million - including 1.7
million who have bought their home under the right to buy scheme. Over the next
10 years, we expect to see another one and a half million people buying their
own homes - some 3,000 every week. To meet that demand, we will continue to
allow local authority and housing association tenants to buy their homes, or
move to houses which they buy.
  We will also carry through our draft Bill, creating the option for those
  buying flats to choose a new form of commonhold ownership.
For those who wish to rent their home, we are encouraging a thriving private
rental market, building on the success of housing investment trusts and
protecting assured tenancies.
Easier renting will help us meet our target of reducing the proportion of empty
homes below 3%. The number of empty houses has fallen in each of the last 3
years. But nothing is more frustrating for people who need social housing, than
the sight of a suitable property owned by the public sector boarded up and
empty. We will stop that.
  Public landlords will have to sell houses which are available for occupation
  yet have been left empty without a good reason for more than 12 months.
Housing associations and housing companies will continue to receive help in
building new homes, and we will encourage more public-private partnerships.
Together, these policies will help meet the demand for new public housing and
make sure that there are decent homes for those in need.
Opportunities for Women
Women are succeeding in Britain. More women have jobs in Britain than in almost
any other European country. Women have a better education, more financial
independence and more opportunities than at any other time in Britain's history.

This success reflects the efforts and determination of many women. Government's
role has been simpler - to level up the playing field, whether in education,
where girls are now doing better than boys, or in the workplace, where
opportunities for women are the best in Europe.
But we know our job is not yet done. Some women still face barriers to doing
well. Some still do not have the financial security they deserve. And crime, and
the fear of crime, often affect women more than men.
We will ensure women have equal opportunities in education and the workplace.
This can best be achieved by keeping our economy buoyant and our labour markets
flexible. And our proposals to bring crime rates down further will help women
especially.
But many women - and some men -face a particular problem: how to juggle job and
family. For those who need or want to work, we will seek further ways to
minimise the barriers to affordable, high quality childcare. For those who wish
to be full-time parents, our proposals to enable them to transfer their unused
personal allowance to their spouse will be worth up to an extra £17.50 a week.
We also want to give women more financial independence, particularly when they
retire. We propose, as explained elsewhere, to improve flexibility in saving for
retirement and to allow courts to split pensions on divorce.
Looking Outwards
The spread of share ownership, the transformation of pension provision, and the
sale of council houses are revolutionising our nation. Personal prosperity and
property ownership are not selfish or inward-looking.
People who are secure at home can look out for others in their community. Over
two thirds of adults engage in some form of voluntary activity. By the end of
1997 all young people aged between 15 and 25 who want to volunteer will be
helped to find an opportunity to do so.
  We will make it easier for those receiving incapacity benefit to volunteer by
  removing the 16 hour weekly limit on their voluntary work.
We will encourage voluntary work by others living on benefit while continuing to
insist that those who are capable of work should actively seek employment. We
will also develop accreditation for voluntary work to encourage employers to see
it as preparation for a paid job.
It is wrong to imagine that compassion must be nationalised and that we can only
help our fellow man through state action.
4. Education and Opportunity
All children dream of what they might do when they grow up. Our task is to help
them turn those dreams into reality whatever their background may be. It is an
exciting world, full of new opportunities for inquiring minds: it should be open
to every child. Their future - and Britain's prosperity - depends on the quality
of their education.
Our Education Guarantee
 A good education is the birthright of every child. Literacy is the building
block of all future learning: English is the global language of commerce and,
much more, a thing of beauty. Without basic science and mathematics, the modern
world is incomprehensible. Every child therefore must be taught to read, write
and add up from an early age.
Years of mistaken, progressive education in the 1960s and 1970s denied these
precious skills to too many children. We have worked ceaselessly since 1979 to
put that right. Our decision to test children and publish the results has
allowed standards to be measured and exposed. We have reformed the curriculum,
toughened inspections, and given more information and power to parents. Our many
excellent teachers now know what is expected of them, and already standards in
schools are rising. But they are still not good enough. We must do more.
Building on what we have done, we can now offer a new pledge to parents - a
guarantee of education standards.
  First, we will set national targets for school performance that reflect our
  objective of ensuring that Britain is in the top league of international
  standards across the whole spectrum of education.
  Second, we will require every school to plan how to improve its performance,
  and to set targets which relate to similar schools and national standards.
  Third, we will give all parents full information on the performance of their
  child's school
  Fourth, to underwrite our pledge, we will ensure action is taken to bring any
  under-performing school up to the mark.
We will meet this pledge by using the full set of levers for improved standards
that we have put in place.
We are revising and simplifying the National Curriculum in primary schools to
emphasise high standards in the basic skills.
Parents and teachers must have an overview of not just how much a child has
learnt while at school, but how the school performs against others. Poor
schooling must not be protected by a veil of secrecy. Parent power is a vital
force for higher standards.
Regular tests and exams are essential if teachers are to discover how much their
pupils have learnt, and parents are to know how much progress their children are
making against national standards. That is why children are already being tested
at 7, 11 and 14.
  We will publish all school test results, including the results of tests of 7
  and 14 year olds.
  We propose also to assess every child at five.
This will give teachers and parents a benchmark against which they can measure
future progress. To give a better measure of pupil's performance, marks out of
100 will be made available to parents as well as the broad-brush levels.
  We will also introduce a new test for 14 year old children that covers the
  whole National Curriculum - assessing progress before they choose subjects for
  GCSE.
Tests and exams need to be rigorous and demanding. We will insist that they
establish children's command of spelling, punctuation, and grammar in English
tests. Children will sit arithmetic tests without calculators. We will not allow
such extensive use of open books in tests and in GCSE exams. We will establish
an English Language GCSE. We will continue to uphold the gold standard of
A-levels, and ensure that the great classics of our literature are studied at
A-level. At the same time students should have the chance to study more subjects
in the sixth form.
Rigorous tests show how individual children and schools are performing and
expose schools that are not giving children the education they deserve. To
underwrite our guarantee, we will then take action to improve standards. We
cannot tolerate schools that fail their pupils.
By this summer every secondary school in the country will have been inspected by
independent inspectors, and by summer 1998, every primary school will have been
inspected as well. We have the power to take over failing schools directly and
close them if necessary We will now go further and require every school to set,
and publish, regular targets, and plans for improving their academic results.
Independent inspectors will monitor the results of weaker schools and their
plans for improvement at regular intervals.
Sometimes, though, schools are failing because the local education authority
which runs them is failing. The authorities with the worst GCSE results and the
worst results at Key Stage 2 (11 year olds) are run by Labour. Those children
need our help.
  We will allow for on independent inspection of education authorities and
  intervene directly to raise standards where education authorities are letting
  children down.
Failing authorities will be required to set out their plans to raise standards,
and work with education teams - directed by independent inspectors - to
implement those plans.
The vast majority of teachers do an outstanding job. They have played a key part
in implementing the reforms that we have introduced. A few, though, let their
pupils down.
  We will establish a more rigorous and effective system of appraising teachers,
  which reflects how well their pupils perform in tests and exams: this will
  identify which teachers need more help and, where necessary, which teachers
  need to be replaced.
Many feel that the professional standing of teachers would be strengthened by
the creation of a single body which could speak with authority on professional
standards. We will consult with teachers and other interested parties about the
possible role of such a body.
The school should be a place of stability and stimulation for children,
especially if they come from a hostile or turbulent environment. To improve
standards in future our new teacher training curriculum will stress traditional
teaching methods -including whole class teaching and learning to read by the
sounds of letters. We will also encourage more teachers to enter the profession
through practical training schemes focused on classroom experience such as the
Graduate Teacher Scheme. A child is likely to learn more in a well-ordered
school. Teachers must have the powers they need to maintain discipline. We will
give teachers greater power to set detentions, to exclude disruptive pupils and
to use reasonable physical restraint where necessary.
Schools also have an important role to play in spiritual and moral education. We
will take steps to ensure that every school fulfils its role of providing
religious education and collective worship.
Choice and Diversity
When we came to power in 1979 the school system was totally dominated by one
type of school - the monolithic comprehensive. The system failed our children.
It treated every child the same. It told parents where to send their children.
It did not give schools the freedom to run their own affairs.
Since 1979 we have created a rich diversity of schools, to serve the varied
talents of all children and give parents choice within that diversity, because
we believe that parents know what is best for their children.
That is why we - and only we - are committed to giving the parent of every four
year old child a voucher for nursery education so they can choose the pre-school
education they want for their child, whether in a play-group, a reception class,
or a nursery school in the private or state sector.
We will give more talented children, from less well-off backgrounds, the
opportunity to go to fee-paying schools by expanding the Assisted Places Scheme
to cover all ages of compulsory education, in line with our current spending
plans. We propose to develop it further into a wider scholarship scheme covering
additional educational opportunities. The freedoms and status of fee-paying
schools will be protected.
Grant-maintained schools have been popular with parents across the country
-whatever their politics. We will encourage more schools to become
grant-maintained and will allow new grant-maintained schools to be set up where
there is sufficient local demand. We will give all grant-maintained schools
greater freedoms to expand and to select their pupils.
Grant-maintained schools are leading the way. Local authority schools are also
benefitting from our policy of local management of schools. Our ultimate
objective is that all schools should take full responsibility for the management
of their own affairs. In the next parliament we will take another step towards
giving them that freedom.
  We will extend the benefits of greater self-governance to all LEA schools. We
  will require local authorities to delegate more of schools' budgets to the
  schools themselves. We will give them more freedom over the employment of
  their staff and over admissions. And, where they want it, we will allow them
  to take over ownership of their assets, so they can make best use of the
  resources.
Local authorities will continue to be responsible for their schools' standards.
They will provide funds, and compete with other organisations to provide
services to schools. We would expect the increased responsibility of
head-teachers, and their role in achieving efficiency-savings, to be recognised
by their pay review body.
Schools are stronger and more effective where head-teachers and governors can
shape their own distinctive character Sometimes that means developing a
speciality in some subjects. Sometimes it means selecting children by their
aptitudes: where parents want this we should not stand in their way. Special
abilities should be recognised and encouraged.
  We will continue to encourage the establishment of more specialist schools in
  technology, arts, languages and sport. We aim to help one in five schools
  become specialist schools by 2001.
  We will allow all schools to select some of their pupils.
  We will help schools to became grammar schools in every major town where
  parents want that choke.
The high standards, real choice and genuine diversity which we have introduced
will produce the best results for all our children.
Lifetime Learning
Lifetime learning is a reality in Britain today. Over a half of all students in
universities, and seventy per cent of those in further education colleges, are
adults who have returned to education later in life. We will continue to create
new opportunities for more people to participate.
There has been a revolution in further and higher education. Three and a half
million people are in further education -up from just half a million in 1979.
The number of young people going to university has risen from one in eight to
one in three over the same period.
We will ensure consistently high standards and will consult on the development
of higher education when we receive the results of the Dearing Review. We have
world class research in British universities which we will continue to support.
Every young person should have the opportunity to continue in education or
training.
  We will give students between 14 and 21 a learning credit which will enable
  them to choose suitable education or training leading to recognised
  qualifications up to A levels or their equivalents.
We will also introduce National Traineeships and encourage employers to offer
more work-based Modern Apprenticeships to young people. Objective external
assessments of a proper syllabus will be made a part of all National Vocational
Qualifications.
We will continue to support the network of Training and Enterprise Councils,
which have created a valuable partnership between business and government. We
will encourage more employers to become involved in ""Investors in People"", with
the public sector matching the performance of the private sector.
Competitive markets demand high skills. If Britain is to win, we need to
encourage learning and give people the opportunity to go where their interests
and inquiring minds take them.



World Class Health and Public Services
Our Record - Health and Public Services
  Government spending has concentrated on priorities, not wasteful bureaucracy
  and overmanning. Despite tough overall public spending plans, real spending on
  the NHS has risen nearly 75% since 1979 , on schools by 50% and on the police
  by more than 100%.
  The Health Service is treating over 1 million more patients each year than
  before our reforms.
  The number of people waiting over 12 months for hospital treatment has fallen
  from over 200,000 in 1990 to 22,000 last year. The average wait has fallen
  from nearly 9 months to 4 months.
  The Government has set up the Citizen's Charter to provide first class public
  services for all citizens. Nearly 650 organisations have received a Charter
  Mark for meeting demanding standards of performance, customer satisfaction and
  value for money.
  There are now 55,000 more nurses and midwives and 22,500 more doctors and
  dentists than in 1979. For every senior NHS manager, 77 people are providing
  direct patient care.
  Nurses average earnings have grown 70% in real terms: from £68 a week in 1979
  to £325 in 1995. Doctor's pay has risen by a third. Under Labour both were
  cut.
  Infant mortality has fallen from 13.2 to 6.2 per thousand over the last 18
  years.
  Deaths through road accidents are now the lowest since records began in 1926.
  Since 1979 road deaths and serious casualties have fallen by 43% despite an
  85% increase in motor traffic.
  The government has invested record amounts on transport - more than £26
  billion since 1979 in investment on motorways and trunk roads; £16 billion in
  investment on railways; and £8 billion in investment on London Transport.
  Privatisation is delivering better services at lower costs. BT's main prices
  are down by more than 40% in real terms. Average household bills for gas and
  electricity have also fallen in real terms since 1990.
5. Security in Health
We have been the guardians of the NHS for most of its life, improving its
services and securing its funding. The benefits can be seen in our rising
standards of health. 1993 was for example the first year in which no child in
this country died of measles. Between 1979 and 1995 life expectancy at birth in
England has increased from 70.4 years to 74.3 years for men and from 76.4 years
to 79.6 years for women. We are getting healthier and we are better looked after
when we are sick.
Growing Resources for a Modern Health Service
This progress has been possible because we have increased spending since 1979 by
nearly 75% more than inflation, to almost £43 billion. And we are not stopping
there. The next Conservative Government will honour a firm guarantee to the NHS.

  We will continue, year by year; to increase the real resources committed to
  the NHS, so NHS spending will continue to share in a growing economy
Under Labour there have been years when resources for the NHS actually shrank -
something that would be inconceivable with the Conservatives.
Money is only really a means to an end: better patient care. Now we are treating
9.2 million hospital in-patients and day cases as against 6.9 million in 1992
and 5.1 million in 1979.
Investing in Skilled Staff
 We are committed to expanding the medical staff of the NHS. We shall therefore
increase medical school intakes to 5,000 a year by the year 2000 and are ahead
of schedule in reaching the target.
Good nursing is the bedrock of the NHS. In particular we will increase the
number of nurses with specialist qualifications in paediatric intensive
care,emergency care, and cancer care. The number of nurses qualifying each year
will increase by 2,500 within the next 5 years as we continue to expand Project
2000 training.
Higher Standards of Service
 We are tackling the problem of long waiting times which can cause so much
worry; distress, and pain. We have set tough targets under the Patient's Charter
and as a result average waiting times for in-patient hospital treatments have
fallen from more than 6 months 5 years ago to 4 months last year.
Patients no longer put up with being kept in ignorance. They want to know more.
  We will publish more information on how successfully hospitals are treating
  patients so that they and their GPs can make more informed choices between
  services in different hospitals and help stimulate better performance
Better Primary Care
Our vision of the NHS is one in which hospitals and family doctors gain greater
power to run their own affairs. That is why we will continue to encourage the
spread of fundholding among GPs. Labour by contrast would destroy the new
freedoms that fundholding doctors enjoy by imposing a new layer of bureaucracy
on top of them.
However, we do not want the benefits of better healthcare to be confined to
patients of GP fundholders. Our proposals to shift more healthcare towards
family doctors are open to all
  We shall implement the new Primary Care Act which will enable all family
  doctors to provide a broader range of patient services within their surgeries.
  This will include (""super surgeries"" and practice-based cottage hospitals that
  can offer faster and more local treatment.
We expect to see the number of nurses working in GP practices continue to grow,
as will the number of GPs.
  We will extend nationwide our plans to enable more nurses to prescribe a wider
  range of drugs for patients, recognising their contribution to primary care.
Mental Health
The last decade has also seen major changes in the care of mentally ill people.
We will continue to develop a full range of services - including 24-hour nursed
hostels and secure units - that can care for them in a way which is most
appropriate to them and the interests of the wider community.
  We will not dose any long-stay mental hospitals unless it can be shown that
  adequate care services exist in the community.
We will strengthen co-operation between health and social services in the
delivery of mental health services. Our recent Green Paper showed how this can
be done. And we will monitor the progress of Health Authorities in developing
proper mental health care plans.
Health of the Nation
A modern health service is not just about treating illness, it is also about
keeping people healthy. This is why we launched the Health of the Nation
strategy in 1992 - the first time England has had a strategy for health. Its aim
is to reduce illness and premature death by identifying common causes of ill
health, like excessive smoking and obesity. Different groups in and outside the
health service then work together to tackle the problems.
We are already seeing progress. Between 1990 and 1994, deaths from coronary
heart disease among the over-65s, the suicide rate, and the number of teenage
pregnancies fell substantially And last year we announced that environmental
targets would be added to Health of the Nation.
Improved general health means fewer people requiring attention in hospitals and
GP surgeries - and more resources available for patients who need them. Our
Health of the Nation strategy is a vital part of our vision for creating a
health service fit for the 21st Century.
A Modern Health Service
Healthcare is changing fast. Modern technology is constantly increasing the
range of treatments which are available. Conservatives believe that the benefits
of these advances should be made available to patients on the basis of their
clinical need, without regard to their ability to pay.
Furthermore we also believe that the NHS must have access to sufficient
resources to allow it to invest in the facilities required to deliver up-to-date
healthcare. Since 1979 capital investment in the NHS has proceeded at an
unprecedented rate. In the future we believe these requirements will be best met
in a partnership with the private sector which allows the private sector to
improve the facilities in which NHS healthcare is delivered.
  We will promote the Private Finance Initiative which will unleash a new flow
  of investment funds into the modernisation of the NHS.
The NHS is a British success story. It commands universal support in Britain. It
is widely admired all over the world. Conservatives are proud of the part we are
playing in improving the NHS still further.
6. Better Public Services
The public sector is being transformed the world over. Britain is in the
vanguard. Everyone else wants to learn from our vision of a smaller state doing
fewer things and doing them better.
Old style public services were centrally planned with little information or
choice for the public who used the service. Our reforms have made these services
more responsive to the public by breaking up cumbersome bureaucratic structures
and shifting power to small responsive local institutions and the people who
work in them. The schools, hospitals and police have all been transformed in
this way. We support the people who do, not the people who plan.
In order to get better standards we are liberating services from centralised
control over capital. We will push forward our Private Finance Initiative to
break down these old barriers.
We have made public services genuinely accountable, with useful information and
real choices for the people who use them. We set tough standards and they will
get tougher. The Citizen's Charter has raised standards of customer service.
When these high standards are reached we recognise and reward excellence through
our Charter Mark initiative. There are now 647 Chartermarks and we will aim for
more than 2000 Chartermarks by the year 2000.
  We will require all government agencies to apply for Chartermarks.
The days of the bureaucratic paperchase are behind us. The future is ""government
direct"". We will harness the latest information technology to place the public
sector directly at the service of the citizen. People will be able to use simple
computer terminals to enter information directly. This will transform
time-consuming transactions like completing a tax return or registering a new
business.
Privatisation and Competition

In 20 years, privatisation has gone from the dream of a few Conservative
visionaries to the big idea which is transforming decaying public sector
industries in almost every country in the world. Britain has led the way with
this new industrial revolution: we can be proud of what we have achieved.
In 1979 the Government inherited a range of businesses which had come into the
public sector for different reasons. Many were known for their poor standards of
service, and most were making large losses.
Over the past eighteen years that situation has changed substantially.
Privatisation has enhanced productivity, improved customer services, raised
safety and environmental standards and substantially reduced prices.
Telephone, gas and electricity bills to the customer have fallen as never
before. Telephone waiting lists are unknown, and water, gas and electricity
disconnections have fallen dramatically. Nearly £40 billion in private sector
funding has been committed to a major investment programme to meet higher
quality water standards. We can now look forward to water prices falling over
the years ahead.
Service standards have improved substantially. Before privatisation published
service standards did not exist. Now industry regulators monitor legal
requirements to provide quality services in a competitive environment. Refunds
may be made when performance standards are not met.
Privatisation has benefitted - and will continue to benefit - consumers,
shareholders, employees, and taxpayers. In 1979 the then-nationalised industries
required a £50 million per week subsidy from the taxpayer In 1996 those now
privatised companies paid taxes of £60 million per week.
  We will ensure private ownership, competition and regulation continue to
  deliver lower prices and better services for consumers.
  We will extend competition for domestic gas users, and introduce competition
  in the water industry, starting with large users.
The Post Office occupies an important part in national life. It comprises
Counter Services, the Royal Mail and Parcelforce. The network of sub-post
offices is vital and most are already run as private businesses. The Royal Mail
provides a universal service at a standard price in every part of the United
Kingdom. No one can imagine a stamp that does not bear the Queen's head. These
characteristics must continue, but reforms are needed to allow the services to
develop. The Royal Mail must face up to the challenges and opportunities that
are arising from increasing competition and the international liberalisation of
services.
  We will guarantee to preserve the national identity, universal service and
  distinctive characteristics of the Royal Mail, while considering options -
  including different forms of privatisation - to introduce private capital and
  management skills into its operations.
  We will transfer Parcelforce to the private sector whilst ensuring that every
  Post Office in the land continues to provide a full parcel service at an
  economical price
Privatisation works. We will therefore continue to pass government activities
into private ownership where this can bring benefits to consumers and taxpayers.

Local Government
We are developing a new vision for local government.
We believe local government should take a lead in the planning and development
of their communities. To achieve that, we have encouraged them to work in
partnership with central government, with private enterprise, and other
organisations in their community. The impact of local government is multiplied
when they work in this way.
To encourage this partnership, we have developed the new approach of Challenge
Funding. We set up a fund to meet a particular objective and then invite
competing bids for the money. Those who form effective partnerships are far more
likely to win those bids. The Single Regeneration Budget Fund, for example, has
stimulated many working partnerships that are bringing new life to their
communities.
  We will push Challenge Funding further to reward effective local government.
This innovation has the potential to transform the financing of the public
sector.
In addition, we are encouraging higher standards and more cost-effective
provision of local services. Local authorities can enable things to happen
rather than necessarily running them themselves. They must look after the
interests of users of their services - and that is often best done by being a
purchaser, not an employer.
Standards of service are rising in many local authorities. There are, however,
still great disparities between the best and worst performers, as the Audit
Commission shows in their thought-provoking reports.
  We will keep up the pressure for higher standards and improved value for money
  by insisting on compulsory competitive tendering.
The development of Challenge Funding and the shift in the role of local
authorities from direct employers to purchasers of services will transform local
authorities over the coming years. In the meantime we will, for so long as is
necessary, retain the power to cap local authorities to protect taxpayers.
Strikes in Essential Services
Industrial relations in this country have been transformed. In so far as there
is a still a problem it is concentrated in a few essential services where the
public has no easy alternative and strikers are able to impose massive costs and
inconvenience out of all proportion to the issues at stake. We will protect
ordinary members of the public from this abuse of power.
  We will legislate to remove legal immunity from industrial action which has
  disproportionate or excessive effect Members of the public and employers will
  be able to seek injunctions to prevent industrial action in these
  circumstances. Any strike action will also have to be approved by a majority
  of all members eligible to vote and ballots will have to be repeated at
  regular intervals if negotiations are extended.
Transport
Our railways are already improving now they have been liberated into the private
sector Passenger numbers are up: more people are using the railways every day.
Investment is up: Railtrack plans to spend £4 million each day on improving
stations and maintaining and renewing the network. The new train operators are
committed to investing £1.5 billion in new and refurbished rolling stock. And
key fares are set to fall in real terms for the first time in a generation, with
guaranteed price controls keeping fare increases below the level of inflation
until at least 2003. We intend to build on this growing success story to create
a thriving railway network for the new century.
  We will complete the successful transfer of British Rail into the commercial
  sector
We now want to draw in private investment to modernise London Underground and
improve services to passengers.
  We will bring forward plans to privatise London Underground. Proceeds from
  privatisation will be recycled in order to modernise the network within 5
  years - creating an underground system to serve the capital in the 21st
  Century. We will regulate fares so they rise by no more than inflation for at
  least 4 years after privatisation. We will also protect services - including
  the Travel Card and concessionary fares.
After completing the modernisation of the network, the majority of the remaining
surplus from privatisation will be channelled into additional support for
transport investment in London and elsewhere in the country.
We will continue to encourage public transport. In particular, we will use the
existing funding for local authorities to promote developments which make it
easier to interchange between bus and rail.
We recognise the needs of road users, and will continue to work with the private
sector to sustain our road building and maintenance programme. Already under the
Private Finance Initiative the private sector is contributing some £1 billion to
investment in roads and achieving significant savings in construction costs. We
will also tackle road congestion by introducing new regional traffic control
centres, by extending the use of variable speed limits, and by ensuring that
local authorities have the necessary powers to act. We will promote a cleaner
environment by supporting a Europe-wide reduction in vehicle emissions, and
encouraging the manufacture of more fuel-efficient vehicles.
We will continue to build on our record of improving safety on roll-on roll-off
ferries and cargo ships through higher standards of survivability and the
measures in the Merchant Shipping Act.
We will continue to make it easier for people to travel by air Already over the
last 5 years opening up the market in Europe has led to more services and lower
fares. We will build on that success in negotiations with the United States and
other countries. We will also continue to encourage the development of regional
airports offering new direct services to the rest of the world in the same way
that we have already opened up new regional links with Europe and the United
States. We will privatise the National Air Traffic Service because it will be
run better in the private sector.
Competition and enterprise are the best way to improve our transport system.




A Safe and Civil Society
Our Record - A Safe and Civil Society
  Spending on the police has doubled since 1979 after allowing for inflation.
  There are now about 16,000 more police officers than when we took office.
  2,360 more constables have been recruited since the last election and the
  Government is giving Chief Officers the resources to recruit 5,000 police
  constables over the 3 years to 1999.
  Recorded crime has dropped in each of the last 4 years. It is now over 10%
  down on 1992 levels - more than half a million fewer offences - the biggest
  drop since records were first kept.
  There are now 153,000 Neighbourhood Watch schemes in England and Wales -
  38,000 more than in 1992 - covering 5.5 million homes. We have helped fund
  over 4,000 closed circuit TV schemes over the last 2 years for additional
  security.
  Our national DNA database - the first in the world - now has over 112,000
  samples on it. 3,300 matches have so far been made between suspects and crime
  stains.
  The Government has increased the maximum penalty for taking a gun to a crime
  and for attempted rape to life imprisonment. Since 1985 the average sentence
  for violence against the person has risen by a third and for sexual offences
  by nearly 40%.
  The number of cars stolen has fallen by nearly 20% in the last four years -
  that is about 100,000 fewer cars stolen.
  We have built 22 new prisons since 1980. Slopping out has ended. No prisoners
  now sleep three to a cell designed for one. Prison escapes have fallen by 80%
  since the last election.
  Mandatory drug testing has been introduced throughout the Prison Service. Home
  leave has been cut back - down by half in two years.
  We have made witness intimidation a crime. 500 people were charged with that
  offence in 1995 alone.
  We have stepped up the fight against drugs and organised crime, giving the
  Security Service powers to support the police and Customs and Excise in
  tracking down the serious criminals.
7. Law, Order and Security
 People have a right to sleep safely in their homes and walk safely on the
streets. Governments have a duty to maintain that security.
Our reforms are aimed at ensuring that crime does not pay. And they are working
- the pessimists and the scoffers are wrong. Recorded crime has fallen every
year for the last 4 years. It is now 10% lower than it was in 1992. That is over
half a million fewer crimes - the biggest drop since records were first kept in
the middle of the 19th century.
But crime is still too high. We must do more. Our aim is to keep crime falling
over the lifetime of the next parliament. This is what we will do.
Safer Communities
Anti-social behaviour and petty crime disrupt communities and spread human
misery. The police are rightly now vigorously tackling problems such as graffiti
vandalism and drunkenness. Where such behaviour goes unchecked more serious
crimes will follow.
  We will support chief constables who develop local schemes to crack down on
  petty crime and improve public order.
Closed circuit television has proved enormously successful in increasing public
safety.
  We will fulfil the Prime Minister's pledge to support the installation of
  10,000 CCTV cameras in town centres and public places in the 3 years to 1999.
  We will provide £75 million over the lifetime of the next parliament to
  continue extending CCTV to town centres, villages and housing estates up and
  down the country that want to bid for support.
We will also continue to take other steps to improve the safety of our streets
and communities. In this parliament we have given the police power to seize
alcohol from under-18s caught drinking in public. The police have been given the
power to stop and search in a specified area for up to 48 hours if they
reasonably believe people to be carrying knives.
Identity Cards can also make a contribution to safer communities.
  We will introduce a voluntary identity card scheme based on the new
  photographic driving licence it will, for example, enable retailers to
  identify youngsters trying to buy alcohol and cigarettes or rent classified
  videos when they are under age.
Tackling Juvenile Crime
A fifth of all crime is committed by under-18s. We are encouraging schools to
reduce truancy through the publication of league tables and by supporting local
projects to tackle the problem. We are developing a network of local teams to
identify children who are at risk of turning to crime and to take early steps to
address the factors which put them at risk.
We will encourage these local child crime teams to refer children from primary
school age upwards who are at risk of, or who are actually, offending to
programmes to tackle their behaviour and fully involve their parents.
  The courts would be able to impose an order - a Parental Control Order - on
  the parents of children whom they believed could keep control of their
  children but were refusing to do so.
Courts will be given the power to attach conditions to Parental Control Orders.
Conditions might include a requirement to keep their children in at night,
taking their children to and from school, attending a drug rehabilitation clinic
or going to sessions to improve their skills as parents. Parents who breached
these conditions - in defiance of the court - would face a range of possible
sanctions.
Appearing before a youth court should be a daunting experience for the juvenile
concerned. All too often it is not. At the moment about a third of all juveniles
appearing before the youth courts are discharged without any punishment at all
This sends all the wrong signals to youngsters - particularly first time
offenders - who then feel they can get away with crime.
  We will give the courts the power to impose speedy sanctions on youngsters,
  involving wherever possible an element of reparation to the victim. The
  probation service - rather than social services - will be responsible for
  enforcing community punishments for under-16s.
Persistent juvenile offenders need to be properly punished. We are piloting a
tough new regime, with a heavy emphasis on discipline, at a young offenders
institution and at the military prison in Colchester In 1994 we doubled the
maximum sentence for 15-17 year olds to 2 years detention in a young offenders
institution. We have given the courts the freedom to allow the publication of
the names of convicted juveniles. We will give the courts the power to detain
persistent 12-14 year old offenders in secure training centres once the places
become available.
We have given the courts the power to impose electronically monitored curfews on
10 to 15 year old offenders. We will introduce pilots to test their
effectiveness. If successful we will consider extending them nationwide.
Catching, Convicting and Punishing
We back the police every inch of the way. There are now about 16,000 more police
officers - and over 18,000 more civilians helping them - than when we took
office. We are providing chief constables with the resources to recruit 5,000
extra police constables in the three years to 1999.
We support police initiatives to target the hard core of persistent criminals.
Intelligence is crucial for this.
  We will establish a national crime squad to provide on improved nationally
  coordinated approach to organised crime.
Once caught, criminals must be convicted and then properly punished. The public
needs to be protected. We have reformed the right to silence, despite opposition
from Labour. The number of suspects refusing to answer police questions has
nearly halved as a result.
We have piloted curfew orders for adult offenders. They have been shown to keep
criminals indoors - curbing their freedom as a punishment - and keeping them out
of trouble in the meantime.
  We will extend electronically monitored curfew orders nationwide for those
  aged 16 and over.
Persistent offenders account for a high proportion of all crime. Prison works -
not only as a deterrent, but in keeping these criminals off the street. Those
sent to prison are less likely to re-offend on release than those given a
community punishment. We will provide another 8,500 prison places by the year
2000.
We will introduce minimum sentences for violent and persistent criminals to help
protect the public more effectively, reversing Labour's wrecking amendments to
our tough Crime Bill.
  Anyone convicted of a second serious sexual or violent crime, like rape or
  armed robbery, will get an automatic life sentence.
  Persistent house burglars and dealers in hard drugs will receive mandatory
  minimum prison sentences of 3 and 7 years respectively.
  We will restore honesty in sentencing by abolishing automatic early release.
Support for Victims
Concern for the victim must be at the heart of our entire approach to the
criminal justice system. We will continue to give strong backing to Victim
Support.
We will give courts in all cases the discretion to allow witnesses to give
evidence anonymously if they believe them to be at risk from reprisal.
  We will also take action to allow a judge to stop a defendant from personally
  questioning the victim in rape cases and other cases where the victim is
  particularly vulnerable.
Conservatives are on the side of the victims not the criminal.
Strengthening the Fight Against City Crime
 Crime that takes place through manipulation of financial accounts and markets
is as serious as crime on the street.
The City's unchallenged position as Europe's most dynamic and successful
financial centre owes a great deal to its reputation for honesty and fair
dealing. We will help ensure that this reputation is maintained.
We will bring forward in the next parliament a package of measures designed to
modernise the current systems for dealing with City fraud.
This will include legislation to allow the Inland Revenue to pass confidential
information to the police, the Serious Fraud Office and the financial regulators
to assist in the investigation of cases involving serious financial fraud. We
will also remove the remaining legal obstacles to the controlled exchange of
confidential information between the police and the regulators in this kind of
case.
Faster Justice
Justice delayed is justice denied. It is wrong that people who are innocent
should face an excessive wait before the start of their trial. The guilty must
be held to account for their actions promptly. And victims should be given the
chance to draw a line under their experience as quickly as possible. We are
determined to speed up justice without diminishing the genuine rights of every
citizen to a fair trial.
Last October the government set up a review of delays in the criminal justice
system. It made a series of detailed recommendations. We see merit in those
recommendations and will seek the views of interested parties. We believe that
taken together they could dramatically speed up the prosecution process,
bringing the guilty to justice and acquitting the innocent more quickly.
All defendants would appear in court the next working day after they were
charged. At least half of them would be convicted the next day compared with
just 3 per cent at the moment. And the time taken to bring juveniles to court
would be cut from 10 weeks to a matter of days.
Civil Justice
The civil justice system of this country is a vital part of its competitive
economy and has a high international reputation. The commercial courts attract
substantial litigation from all over the world, generating significant foreign
earnings. We will work to maintain the high standing of these courts.
We have greatly improved the service the civil courts provide for the aggrieved
citizen. The simple procedure for small claims has been extended to claims up to
£3,000. For large claims the county court now provides an efficient local
service with specialised courts in many locations around the country leaving the
High Court to deal with the more complex and difficult issues.
We will push ahead with the major reforms now under way which will greatly speed
up the process and improve the delivery of justice without imposing additional
burdens on the taxpayer.
The Legal Profession
We will ensure that the framework in which the legal profession operates is
responsive to the changing needs of our people and is one in which unjustified
restrictions have no place. We have, for example, given most solicitors rights
of audience in the higher courts under appropriate conditions.
Legal Aid
People are rightly concerned about the rising costs of legal aid. We have taken
many steps to control the burden and to deny access to legal aid to the
""apparently wealthy"" - those who qualified technically, but whose lifestyles
suggested they should not.
But more is required:
  We will change the structure of legal aid to ensure that it, like other vital
  public services, functions within defined cash limits.
This will enable us to identify priorities and serve them much more efficiently
than the present system.
Drugs
Drugs are a menace to the very fabric of our society They ruin the lives of
addicts and their families. They can destroy whole neighbourhoods. The promising
youth of today can too easily become the sad dropouts of tomorrow turning to
crime and violence.
The Conservative Government has a comprehensive strategy, launched in 1995,
committed to fighting drugs in communities and in schools. It is tough on
criminals and vigilant at our ports. It is respected throughout the world. We
spend over £500m every year in tackling all aspects of drug problems.
  We will continue the fight against drugs through a coordinated approach: being
  tough on pushers; reducing demand by educating young people; tackling drug
  abuse at local level through Drug Action Teams; saying ""No"" to legalising
  drugs; and working with international agencies and foreign governments to
  resist the menace spreading.
This pernicious evil has to be fought by all of us.



A Confident, United and Sovereign Nation
Our Record - The Nation
  Many of our old cities have been rejuvenated through a partnership of public
  and private investment.
  The area of green belt has doubled since 1979.
  Water and air quality in the UK have improved significantly.
  We are one of only a few nations on course to meet our commitment to return
  emissions of all greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2000.
  The Lottery has been established as the most successful in the world - raising
  £3 billion for good causes in a little over 2 years.
  More support is now given to arts and heritage than at any time in our
  nation's history. We now provide nearly 20% more for the arts than the last
  Labour Government, over and above inflation.
  British talent was this year nominated for 30 Oscars. British music is again
  receiving international acclaim. The industry is worth £2.5 billion, more than
  shipbuilding or electric components: one in 5 CDs and records sold anywhere
  has a British connection.
  There is record investment in our sports facilities. Already the Lottery has
  provided £480 million for sport, including the planned British Academy of
  Sport, English National Stadium and, for the first time, direct funding for
  British athletes.
  We have continued to stand up for British interests in Europe, protecting our
  opt-out from the Social Chapter, maintaining our border controls, and
  preserving our budget rebate - worth £18 billion since it was introduced.
  We have the most professional armed forces in the world. We have modernised
  our nuclear deterrent by replacing Polaris with Trident.
8. The Best Place in the World to Live
Britain is admired the world oven Every year, millions of tourists travel here
to enjoy our heritage and culture, our cities and countryside, our way of life.
Our nation's history is an anchor in a sea of change. We need to protect,
cherish and build upon what is great about our country so our children grow up
in a better Britain. We also must make sure that everyone, wherever they live,
has the support of a strong, tolerant and civilised community.
Our aim is for this generation and future generations to take pride in Britain
as the best place in the world to live.
Britain's Cities
London is one of the world's greatest cities. It is livelier than even Our
vision of its future is set out in a separate manifesto.
Many of our cities have undergone a complete transformation over the last
decade. We have promoted partnerships -through schemes such as Urban Development
Corporations, the Single Regeneration Budget and City Pride - to attract private
enterprise and investment back to inner-cities. These initiatives are bringing
hope, opportunity and prosperity to what were once wastelands of urban decline.
As the country thrives and becomes more prosperous, one of our central tasks is
to apply the same approach in transforming the legacy of soulless, decaying
public housing estates. They are places that suffer from the very worst kind of
poverty - poverty of aspiration.
We have already made a start - spending more than £2bn over the last 10 years on
improving 500 of the worst estates. And we have shown how it is possible to
tackle the economic and social problems alongside new investment in buildings -
where possible, bringing in a greater mix of public tenants and private housing
to recreate a more balanced community. Now we will extend this approach,
focusing the Single Regeneration Budget to launch a combined attack on crime,
unemployment and under-achievement, and developing the government's partnership
with the private sector to help fund the massive investment that will be
required.
  Over the next decade, we aim to raise some £25bn of new private investment in
  housing estates by encouraging tenants in more than half of the remaining
  public sector housing stock to opt for transferring their homes to new
  landlords. These transfers will only occur where tenants choose this mute to
  improve theft estates.
  We will use this approach to regenerate the worst housing estates and
  transform the lives of those who live in them - targeting support for
  programmes to improve education standards, employment and crime prevention
  alongside new private sector investment.
As well as this attack on poor housing, we will continue to help the homeless.
We will carry through our planned extension of the Rough Sleeper Initiative from
London to other big cities.
  We will provide sufficient hostel places to ensure that no-one need sleep out
  on the streets.
Rural Communities
Britain is blessed with some of the most beautiful countryside in Europe.
  We need to protect the best of the countryside whilst ensuring good jobs and
  living conditions for people who live there.
We have to strike a balance: our rural communities must not become rural
museums, but remain vibrant places to live
and work. We will make sure government departments work together to ensure that
balance is kept.
We will continue to protect the green belt from development, making sure that
derelict and under-used urban land is developed in preference to greenfield
sites.
  We will use the planning system to ensure that more new homes are built on
  reclaimed sites in our towns and cities. We will aim for more than 60 per cent
  of all new homes to be built on derelict sites.
This will reduce the pressure to build in our countryside and expand choice
where it is needed most.
We will support our rural communities, by giving special rate support to small
village shops and post offices. The planning system can do more to help too.
  We will introduce a new Rural Business Use Class to encourage job creation in
  the countryside.
  We will increase support for schemes which promote care for the countryside -
  like Countryside Stewardship.
We believe participation in traditional country pursuits, including fishing, is
a matter for individuals. A Conservative Government will not introduce
legislation that interferes with the rights of people to take part in these
activities.
We will also encourage managed public access to private land - in agreement with
farmers and landowners - but strongly resist a general right to roam, which
would damage the countryside and violate the right to private property.
We aim to double Britain's forest cover over the next fifty years. We will
continue to encourage tree planting by targeting grants, encouraging investment
in wood processing, and using new freedoms with the reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy.
Agriculture and Fisheries
We will continue to provide robust support to the British beef industry through
the BSE crisis until its long term strength is restored. We will vigorously
pursue the eradication of BSE in the United Kingdom, as we have been doing
successfully for the last eight years. We will spare no efforts in our fight
against the unwarranted ban on British beef exports.
Public health and food safety have been the government's top priorities
throughout the BSE crisis.
  We will tighten up control over food safety by appointing a powerful and
  independent Chief Food Safety Adviser and Food Safety Council to advise
  government
We will continue to push for fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural
Policy, moving away from production support to measures that will give our
farmers the opportunity to compete while safeguarding the rural environment. We
will ensure that no change to the Common Agricultural Policy unfairly
disadvantages British farmers.
Fishing is a vital industry in many parts of coastal Britain. We will continue
our fight to secure a prosperous long term future for the industry and
sustainable management of our fish stocks.
  We will insist at the IGC and elsewhere on measures to stop quota hopping and
  prevent the vessels of other countries from using UK fishing quotas.
The integrity of our 6 and 12 mile fishing limits is not negotiable. We reject
any idea of a single European fishing fleet.
We believe that fishermen should have more say in decisions affecting their
industry We will press the European Commission to establish regional committees
to give fishermen a direct influence in fishing policy. We will use these
committees to develop new ways of managing quotas and regulating fisheries which
are more sensitive to the industry's needs.
Animal Welfare
A civilised society respects animals. Britain will continue to take the lead in
improving standards of animal welfare in Europe. In 1995 we secured a major
breakthrough in the treatment of animals in transport; in 1996 we won victory in
our campaign to ban veal crates throughout the EU. We are determined that
standards should continue to rise and that all EU countries should have to meet
them.
  We will seek to ensure that all European countries have to raise animal
  welfare standards.
We are not going to take any risks with rabies. There may however be ways other
than quarantine which maintain or increase protection for public health, while
improving the welfare of pets and reducing the costs to travellers.
  We will publish a Green Paper on rabies protection, setting out all the
  options including the existing controls, early in the new parliament.
Britain's Environment Britain has an enviable track record in protecting our
environment. Our rivers, beaches and water are cleaner and we are using our
energy more efficiently. We are leading the world in reducing the level of the
""greenhouse gases"" that cause global warming and pressing for policies that will
enable the world to sustain development
without long-term damage to the environment. Our Green Manifesto is published
separately.
We have clear objectives to build on this record. We will set tough, but
affordable targets, with published environmental strategies to improve air
quality and banish city smog - with tighter standards on vehicle emissions and
pollution crackdowns around the country We aim for sustained improvements in
water quality, at a pace which industry and consumers can afford. We will
develop labelling of products that gives consumers information to show the
environmental impact of how they were made.
In addition, we will continue to use the tax system and other incentives to
encourage the use of vehicles and fuel which do not pollute the environment. And
we will continue to explore policies based on the principle of polluter pays:
those who contaminate land, pollute the environment or produce harmful waste
should be made responsible for their actions and pay for the consequences.

Britain - A Tolerant Country
Tolerance, civility and respect have always been hallmarks of our nation. It is
thanks to them that we have an excellent record in race relations.
Everybody, regardless of colour or creed, has the right to go about his or her
life free from the threat of intimidation. We are taking tough action to tackle
harassment. Under proposals in the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, it will
be a crime to behave in a way which causes someone else to be harassed. The
maximum penalty will be 6 months in prison.
Firm, but fair, immigration controls underpin good race relations. We will
ensure that, while genuine asylum seekers
are treated sympathetically, people do not abuse these provisions to avoid
normal immigration controls.
A World Leader In Sports, Arts and Culture
Britain is enjoying a cultural renaissance. British music, films, television,
fashion, art and food are winning plaudits the world oven They add excitement,
fun and enjoyment to our lives. Our success brings pride to everyone.
The National Lottery, which John Major set up, will pump billions of pounds into
Britain's good causes. Its proceeds will weave a new, rich thread of opportunity
and charity into the tapestry of British life. In addition to benefitting major
national institutions, about half of the awards are for amounts under £25,000 -
benefitting local communities up and down the country. We will encourage new
ways of distributing awards to support the performing arts - through support for
amateur productions and community events, providing more musical instruments,
and helping productions tour round the country.
 The National Lottery will also help us train and promote British sporting
talent. The English National Stadium and British Academy of Sport, funded by the
Lottery, will be new focal points for sporting events and excellence. We will
encourage more young people to play sport by ensuring every school plays a
minimum level of sport, including competitive sports, and developing a network
of Sporting Ambassadors - sporting celebrities who will visit schools to inspire
young people. We will also encourage the Sports Council to use Lottery money to
employ over 1000 additional community sports coaches to assist in schools.
  We will encourage the use of Lottery money to train young athletes and
  artists, with revenue funding for bursaries, concessionary tickets to
  professional performances and support for young people's organisations and
  productions.
The development of young talent is important in all fields.
The Lottery will also fund our Millennium celebrations. They will be
inspirational as well as enjoyable. We want these be a showcase of British
excellence. Britain will be able to look back on past achievements with pride,
and look forward with confidence.
9. Europe and the World
Britain is a world leader as well as a European nation. Our economic strength,
our history and our language make us a global trading nation with links right
around the world. Only the United Kingdom is a member of the European Union, the
United Nations Security Council, the Commonwealth, NATO and the Group of Seven
leading industrial nations. In the Gulf, Bosnia, Cyprus and Northern Iraq, John
Major has shown how our nation can contribute to world peace.
We will continue to work with international partners to secure peace and
stability in areas of tension such as former Yugoslavia; in Kashmir; in Cyprus;
and in the Middle East. We will promote reform of the United Nations to make it
a more effective organisation for securing international stability. Britain will
continue to deploy our outstanding Armed Forces as peacekeepers under the United
Nations. And we will support the aspirations of the Poles, Czechs, Hungarians
and others to join the European Union and NATO.
After the transfer of Hong Kong, we will work under the terms of the Joint
Declaration to help sustain the prosperity and way of life of the people of Hong
Kong and build on the substantial British interests that will remain.
We will continue to support the Commonwealth, our unique global network, to
encourage the spread of democracy; as set out in the Harare Declaration. We will
focus our aid programme to encourage sustainable development in countries that
are growing towards self sufficiency under democratic government. We have taken
the lead in alleviating the burden of debt for the world's poorest countries. We
also have significant flows of private investment to developing economies. We
are more than achieving the long term UN target of 1% of GDP for the transfer of
wealth to less developed countries. We will continue to maintain a significant
bilateral and multilateral aid programme reflecting the aspiration of meeting
the UN's target of 0.7% of GDP for aid as a long-term objective.
We will also continue to provide leadership in Europe and internationally on
environmental issues, building on the Rio Conference to encourage sustainable
development - meeting our commitment to reduce Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions by
10% on 1990 levels by 2010 to prevent climate change. The Prime Minister has
committed himself to attending the next UN Environmental Conference in June.
Britain and the European Union
We believe that in an uncertain, competitive world, the nation state is a rock
of security. A nation's common heritage, culture, values and outlook are a
precious source of stability. Nationhood gives people a sense of belonging.
The government has a positive vision for the European Union as a partnership of
nations. We want to be in Europe but not run by Europe. We have much to gain
from our membership of the European Union -in trade, in co-operation between
governments, and in preserving European peace. We benefit from the huge trade
opportunities that have opened up since Britain led the way in developing
Europe's single market. We want to see the rest of Europe follow the same
deregulated, enterprise policies that have transformed our economic prospects in
Britain.
However, in June, the nations of the European Union will gather in Amsterdam to
negotiate possible amendments to the Treaty of Rome. It is a moment of truth,
setting the direction in which the European Union will go. It will also be
crucial in ensuring that we have a relationship with the rest of Europe with
which we can be comfortable.
  A Conservative Government will seek a partnership of nation states. Some
  others would like to build a federal Europe. A British Conservative Government
  will not allow Britain to be part of a federal European state.
The diversity of Europe's nations is its strength. As more nations join the
European Union, it needs to become flexible not more rigid We must also ensure
that any developments which only include some members do not work to the
disadvantage of others.
Our priorities for Europe's development will be enlargement of the Community,
completion of the single market, reform of the European Court of Justice, and
further strengthening of the role of national parliaments. We will seek more
co-operation between national governments on areas of common interest - defence,
foreign policy and the fight against international crime and drugs. We also
believe the European Union itself should do less, but do it better. So we have
proposed incorporating the principle of subsidiarity - that the European Union
should only do that which cannot be done by member states acting alone - into
the Treaty. This is how we are approaching the Inter-Governmental Conference.
  We will argue for a flexible Europe which fully accommodates the interests and
  aspirations of all its member states and where any new proposals have to be
  open to all and agreed by all. We will not accept other changes to the Treaty
  that would further centralise decision-making, reduce national sovereignty, or
  remove our right to permanent opt-outs.
  We will retain Britain's veto and oppose further extension of qualified
  majority voting in order to ensure we can prevent policies that would be
  harmful to the national interest. We will defend the rights of national
  parliaments and oppose more powers being given to the European Parliament at
  the expense of national parliaments.
  We will take whatever steps are necessary to keep our frontier controls. We
  will resist attempts to change the inter-governmental nature of co-operation
  in justice and home affairs. We will not accept the development of new legal
  rights that extend the concept of European citizenship.
Britain's rebate has so far saved British taxpayers £18bn and we will protect
it.
 One of the greatest challenges Europe faces is to cut unemployment and make its
businesses competitive. Here Britain is leading the way. We will continue to
argue for deregulation and lower costs on Europe's businesses, the policies that
have helped give Britain one of the strongest economies in Europe. We will not
put that achievement at risk by signing up to the Social Chapter, which would
open the door to imposing the high costs of the European social model on British
business. Once Britain accepted the Social Chapter we could not stop many of
these damaging policies being imposed on us by qualified majority voting.
We will insist that any new Treaty recognises that our opt-out from the Social
Chapter enables Britain to be exempt from the Working Time Directive, and
prevents any abuse of our opt-out. And we will not accept a new employment
chapter in any revised Treaty, which would expose British businesses to new
costs.
We made it clear in the previous chapter that we will continue to work for
further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the lifting of the
worldwide ban on British beet and will insist on measures to stop quota hopping
by foreign fishing vessels.
Protecting Britain's interests demands tough, experienced negotiation. John
Major has proved he has these qualities -including the resolve to say no when
necessary even if that means being isolated. Labour have said they would never
let Britain be isolated in Europe: they would damage Britain's success by
undermining our veto, signing up to the Social Chapter and following in others'
footsteps - even where they lead in the wrong direction. They support policies
that would fragment the United Kingdom's influence within a Europe of Regions.
The Liberal Democrats welcome the end of the nation state. Only the
Conservatives can be trusted to stand up for Britain in Europe: our national
interest must be protected.
A Single Currency: Our Referendum Guarantee
The creation of a European single currency would be of enormous significance for
all European states whether they are members or not. We must take account of all
the consequences for Britain of such a major development of policy.
John Major secured for us at Maastricht an opt-out from the commitment to enter
a single currency. It is only because of this opt-out that we have the right to
negotiate and then decide whether it is in Britain's interest to join.
It is in our national interest to take part in the negotiations. Not to do so
would be an abdication of responsibility. A single currency would affect us
whether we were in or out. We need to participate in discussions in order to
ensure the rules are not fixed against our interests. The national interest is
not served by exercising our option - one way or the other - before we have to.
For a single currency to come into effect, European economies will have to meet
crucial criteria. On the information currently available, we believe that it is
very unlikely that there will be sufficient convergence of economic conditions
across Europe for a single currency to proceed safely on the target date of
January 1st 1999. We will not include legislation on the single currency in the
first Queen's Speech. If it cannot proceed safely, we believe it would be better
for Europe to delay any introduction of a single currency rather than rush ahead
to meet an artificial timetable. We will argue this case in the negotiations
that lie ahead.
  We believe it is in our national interest to keep our options open to take a
  decision on a single currency when all the facts are before us. If a single
  currency is created, without sustainable convergence, a British Conservative
  government will not be part of it.
  If, during the course of the next parliament, a Conservative government were
  to conclude that it was in our national interest to join a single currency, we
  have given a guarantee that no such decision would be implemented unless the
  British people gave their express approval in a referendum.
Defence in an Unstable World
The old rivalries of the Cold War have been replaced by new tensions. Britain
must be able to react rapidly to protect our security and interests around the
globe.
Our armed forces are the most professional in the world. We have cut unnecessary
bureaucracy and increased efficiency, and directed money to support our Services
in the frontline. We have made the changes necessary to adapt our Services to
the threats which we might now face. We have set out defence plans based on
stable levels of funding. There is no need for a defence review, which would
raise fear and uncertainty about the future.
We will continue to ensure the Services have the modern weapons they need to
guarantee their superiority against potential aggressors. We will make sure we
can conduct military operations throughout the world, and develop our capability
to deploy the three services together and rapidly, including the ability to
transport heavy equipment into an operational zone. We will take part in
ballistic missile defence research so we can decide whether we should procure
any such system for the United Kingdom.
We will continue to target our efforts on recruiting for the armed forces. We
will set up an Army Foundation College, which will provide 1,300 places for 16
and 17 year olds who want to join the Army. We will also enable the reserve
forces to play a more active role in operations. We appreciate the enormous
value of cadet forces, and our current plans include resources to encourage
their further development.
We will continue to support Britain's defence industry, and we will work with
companies to identify the technologies of the future.
NATO will remain the cornerstone of our security. We will resist attempts to
bring the Western European Union under the control of the European Union, and
ensure that defence policy remains a matter for sovereign nations.
10. The Constitution
Alone in Europe, the history of the United Kingdom has been one of stability and
security; We owe much of that to the strength and stability of our constitution
- the institutions, laws and traditions that bind us together as a nation.
Our constitution has been stable, but not static. It has been woven over the
centuries - the product of hundreds of years of knowledge, experience and
history.
Radical changes that alter the whole character of our constitutional balance
could unravel what generations of our predecessors have created. To preserve
that stability in future - and the freedoms and rights of our citizens - we need
to continue a process of evolution, not revolution.
Conservatives embrace evolutionary change that solves real problems and improves
the way our constitution works. In recent years we have opened up government,
devolved power and accountability, and introduced reforms to make parliament
work more effectively. It is that evolutionary process that we are committed to
continue.
Open, Accountable Government
In recent years we have taken significant steps to open up government to public
scrutiny, and give individuals more information to hold government and public
services to account.
We have introduced a code on access to government information, policed by the
Ombudsman. We have published information on the workings of government
previously held secret -including the composition of cabinet committees, and the
structure of the security and intelligence services. We have introduced a new
civil service code, and reformed the process for public appointments. We are
pledged to legislate on the commitments in our 1993 White Paper on Open
Government, including a statutory right of access by citizens to personal
records held about them by the government and other public authorities. And we
have set up the Nolan Committee and have implemented its proposals to ensure
that the highest standards are maintained in public life.
But our reforms go even wider than that. We have transferred power from central
bureaucracies to local organisations such as school governors and hospital
trusts. We have introduced the Citizen's Charter We have also required them to
publish information on their performance -information which enables the local
community to keep a check on standards and apply pressure where needed. Wherever
possible, we are widening competition and choice in public services. We showed
in Chapter 6 how we wished to push this agenda forward.
Regional government would be a dangerously centralising measure - taking power
away from elected local authorities. We wish to go in the opposite direction,
shifting power to the local neighbourhood - for example, by giving more power to
parish councils.
Parliament
Parliament - alongside the Crown and our legal system - is one of the three key
institutions that uphold our constitution. The supremacy of parliament is
fundamental to our democracy, and the guarantee of our freedoms. The last 17
years have seen many changes to strengthen parliament and make it more effective
- the flourishing of select committees, new procedures to scrutinise European
legislation, reform of parliament's working day, and a budget that brings
together tax and spending.
We have therefore already done much to improve the way parliament works and will
do more. We have accepted the proposal from the Public Service Select Committee
and put before the House of Commons a clear new statement of the principles
underlying ministerial accountability to parliament.
All these developments have made parliament open to the citizen, and the
government more accountable. In the next session of parliament we will continue
this careful reform.
  To give parliament more time to consider legislation thoroughly we will extend
  the Queen's Speech to cover not only legislation for the immediate year but
  also provisional plans for legislation in the year after that
This will mean that more draft bills will be subject to public scrutiny before
they reach the floor of the House of Commons. It will give select committees
more time to take evidence and report. And this should also mean better
legislation.
We do not believe there is a case for more radical reform that would undermine
the House of Commons. A new Bill of Rights, for example, would risk transferring
power away from parliament to legal courts - undermining the democratic
supremacy of parliament as representatives of the people. Whilst this may be a
necessary check in other countries which depend upon more formalised written
constitutions, we do not believe it is appropriate to the UK.
Nor do we favour changes in the system of voting in parliamentary elections that
would break the link between an individual member of parliament and his
constituents. A system of proportional representation would be more likely to
produce unstable, coalition governments that are unable to provide effective
leadership - with crucial decisions being dependent on compromise deals hammered
out behind closed doors. This is not the British way.
We have demonstrated we are not against change where it is practical and
beneficial. But fundamental changes which have not been fully thought through -
such as opposition proposals on the House of Lords - would be extremely
damaging. We will oppose change for change's sake.
The Union
The Union between Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England underpins our
nation's stability. The Conservative commitment to the United Kingdom does not
mean ignoring the distinctive individuality of the different nations. On the
contrary, we have gone further in recognising that diversity than any previous
government. We are publishing separate manifestos for Wales and Scotland.
While preserving the role of parliament at the centre of the Union, we have
given new powers to the Scottish Grand Committee and Welsh Grand Committee -
enabling Scottish and Welsh MPs to call Ministers to account and debate
legislation which affects those countries - something that would be impossible
with separate Assemblies. For the first time, Welsh members of parliament can
ask their questions to Ministers in Welsh in Wales. Most recently we have
similarly extended the basic powers of the Northern Ireland Grand Committee.
We believe this is the right way to go. By contrast, the development of new
assemblies in Scotland and Wales would create strains which could well pull
apart the Union. That would create a new layer of government which would be
hungry for power. It would risk rivalry and conflict between these parliaments
or assemblies and the parliament at Westminster. And it would raise serious
questions about whether the representation of Scottish and Welsh MPs at
Westminster - and their role in matters affecting English affairs - could remain
unchanged.
Nor do we believe it would be in the interests of the Scottish or Welsh people.
A Scottish tax-raising parliament, for example, could well affect the choice of
where new investment locates in the United Kingdom.
In a world where people want security, nothing would be more dangerous than to
unravel a constitution that binds our nation together and the institutions that
bring us stability. We will continue to fight for the strength and diversity
that benefits all of us as a proud union of nations.
Northern Ireland
While we cherish the Union and Northern Ireland's place within it, we recognise
that there exist within the Province special circumstances which require further
action to be taken.
After a quarter of a century we wish to see the unique and originally temporary
system of direct rule ended and a successful restoration of local accountable
democracy achieved. We want to see this brought about in a form which carries
the broadest agreement possible. And we want to see the rights, traditions and
interests of all parts of the community recognised within any such agreement.
We will accordingly continue to pursue a policy of dialogue and negotiation with
and between the democratic Northern Ireland parties. We will continue to
underpin such negotiations with the guarantee that the constitutional position
of Northern Ireland cannot and will not be changed without the broad consent of
the people of Northern Ireland. At the same time we will continue to take
whatever security measures are required to protect the people of Northern
Ireland from those who seek to achieve their political goals by violent means.
We seek peace. But we will never be swayed by terrorist violence nor will we
ever compromise our principles with those who seek to overthrow the rule of law
by force.
A Choice of Two Futures
At this election the British people face a stark choice. A choice of two
futures.
They can elect to continue down the road of success and achievement. An
opportunity that has been hard won by the efforts and sacrifices of the British
people. An opportunity that has only come about because successive Conservative
governments have been determined to face up to the long term problems facing
Britain, and take the tough steps needed to arrest our slow decline.
Or they can elect to take a huge risk with that future - the future of
themselves, their children, their nation - by handing over the government of the
country to politicians who have fought, opposed and denigrated every step that
has been taken to restore Britain's economic health and standing in the world.
Politicians whose own declared policies would burden the United Kingdom with new
spending and taxation, new regulations, and new threats to the stability and
sovereignty of the nation itself.
You can only be sure with the Conservatives.

"
UK_natl_1979_en_Lab.txt,"British Labour Party election manifesto: 1979'The Labour Way is the Better Way'


Foreward:
Now, more than ever, we need Labour's traditional values of cooperation, social
justice, and fairness. This manifesto restates these Labour principles in an
action programme with a strong sense of the future. They appeal to all our
people - young and old.
The world is changing rapidly. New industrial nations are rising to challenge
our key industries on which British jobs and living standards depend.
The Labour Government is taking firm action to equip Britain to adapt to these
changes and to seize new opportunities. And we will take great care to protect
working people and their families from the hardships of change.
But although the 1980s will present a tough challenge, this country will have
many things in our favour. North Sea oil offers a golden prospect as do our
reserves of natural gas and coal. We must use these resources wisely to plan our
future to create new wealth, new jobs, and to look after the family, the
elderly, and those in need.
Too much is at stake to let the Conservatives frustrate the hopes of the coming
decade by turning back the clock to the policies that they tried in the early
seventies and that failed so badly before.
The Government's industrial strategy is about how to create more wealth and more
jobs through a constructive national partnership with unions and management. The
Conservatives will not admit that nowadays governments must step in to help
create employment, to limit prices rises, to assist industry to modernize
itself. They are ready to gamble the people's future on a return to the
nineteenth century free market' - despite its pitiless social consequences. They
are as dangerously out of their time as a penny farthing on the motorway.
Together the people and the Labour Government, even without a parliamentary
majority, have achieved much these past five years, as the manifesto shows. In
an uncertain world suffering the worst economic trouble for 40 years we have
pointed the way forward.
But nobody who cares about Britain can rest satisfied until far, far more has
been accomplished. As long as there are men and women struggling with low pay,
mothers stretching the household budget to make ends meet, youngsters in search
of a job, children learning in out of date classrooms, patients queuing for a
hospital bed or families without a decent home - then there is work for a Labour
Government.
Our purpose is to overcome the evils of inequality, poverty, racial bigotry, and
make Britain truly one nation.
For these we need a Labour majority in Parliament. This manifesto sets out our
aims for the next five years. Here are five of our priorities.
1. We must keep a curb on inflation and prices. Inflation is our enemy because
rising prices hit most hardly at the pensioner, the low paid and the housewife,
and inflation causes loss of jobs. Labour has brought inflation down from the
alarming level caused by the Conservatives' failure to control the supply of
money.
Now we set ourselves the task of bringing inflation down to 5 per cent in three
years. It is an ambitious target. We need the assistance of everyone. And
everyone will be better off if we succeed.
2. We will carry forward the task of putting into practice the new framework to
improve industrial relations that we have hammered out with the TUC. The first
step has been the creation of a new standing pay commission which will prevent
the disruption of services to the public in future.
Next, each year there will be three-way talks between ministers, management and
unions to consider the best way forward for our country's economy. Germany's
Social Democratic Government under Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt has proved
that this is a good way to reach agreement on how to expand output, incomes and
living standards.
I am realistic enough to know that there are bound to be set backs. But
experience reinforces what all of us know in our hearts - there is no sound
alternative to working together.
A Conservative free-for-all in pay and prices would mean endless pitched battles
that would be fatal to the interests of all of us. The Labour way is the better
way.
3. We give a high priority to working for a return to full employment. A good
job is a basic human right. During the last five years we have responded to the
worldwide unemployment crisis by helping more than one million people to take up
new jobs or new training.
Now we will concentrate special attention on more jobs and training for the
regions, the young and the long-term unemployed, and give them hope for the
future.
4. We are deeply concerned to enlarge people's freedom. Our policy will be to
tilt the balance of power back to the individual and the neighbourhood, and away
from the bureaucrats of town hall, company board room, the health service and
Whitehall.
Industrial democracy - giving working men and women a voice in the decisions
which affect their jobs - is an idea whose time has come. Council tenants will
have more freedom from bureaucratic control in their own homes. Parents and
teachers will have a greater freedom to influence the running of their
children's schools. Whitehall will devolve power, in an acceptable form to
Scotland. Local services will be handed back to local authorities closer to the
people. These are practical ways to set the people free.
5. We will use Britain's influence to strengthen world peace and defeat world
poverty. Europe has been at peace for over 30 years but ours is still a
dangerous world with more armaments than ever before. Labour will keep Britain
strong but we will also work hard for disarmament. It cannot be right that 15
million children in poorer countries die before they are five - yet the world
spends so much on the means of destruction. There is a compelling moral need to
raise the standard of life of all the world's citizens - no matter where they
live.
We are ready and willing to work with our European partners in closer unity. But
we must record that in some aspects of its work the Common Market lacks common
sense.
Above all the agricultural policy is wasteful and expensive. In standing
squarely against the discredited aspects of the dear-food policy, we are in fact
defending the interests of European families just as much as British families. A
nonsense is a nonsense in any language.
The Labour Government will give a strong lead in the decade ahead. But no
government can do it all. Our purpose is to deepen the sense of unity and
kinship and community feeling that has always marked out our fellow countrymen
and women. No nation can succeed by accepting benefits without responsibilities.
I ask everybody who shares our ideals and our faith in Britain to join with us
in securing the return of a government that dares to turn the dream of a caring
society into practical action. And then work with us to complete the building of
a Britain offering hope, social justice, and fairness to all.
James Callaghan


This election is about the Britain of tomorrow - the kind of country we want to
live in, the kind of community we wish for our children. In choosing their
government, the people will be deciding what values and ideals will guide the
nation in the critical years ahead. In this manifesto, Labour puts forward its
policies for the future. The Labour Party is a democratic socialist party and
proud of it. Labour seeks to build a stronger and more prosperous Britain - and
we are determined to see that all our people share fully in that prosperity. We
want a Britain which is open and democratic and which puts fair earnings for
working people and the needs of the under-privileged before the demands of
private profit.
Over the past five years, the Labour Government have laid the foundations of a
stronger economy.
When Labour came to govern, in March, 1974, Britain was facing the most
dangerous crisis since the war. The Tory programme of confrontation and social
injustice had brought the country almost to its knees. Unlit streets, unheated
homes, shut-down factories - these were the fruits of the Tory three-day week.
We were £1,000m in deficit in our national balance of payments, even before the
rising oil prices. Prices were soaring month by month. Industry was enfeebled by
years of under-investment. To top it all, Britain then had to contend with the
four-fold rises in oil prices and the worldwide inflation and unemployment.
Our inheritance was a Britain in crisis. The new Labour Government sought
cooperation in place of confrontation. Instead of division, we offered social
justice. In place of compulsion, we worked to win consent for the tough economic
measures we knew were needed. We forged a new partnership between the Labour
Government and working people.
Our country has come a long way since then. The rate of inflation has been
brought under control. It has become possible to improve living standards, to
cut taxation and increase child benefit, pensions and benefits to the disabled
to rates which more than overtake costs and inflation.
And over the past year, unemployment has at last begun to fall. Now we offer a
programme to carry Britain through the 1980s.
The Fight against Rising Prices
Nothing so undermines a nation as inflation. Not only does it make the family's
task of budgeting more difficult, it is a threat to jobs and a standing
invitation to our overseas competitors to invade our markets.
Now, with the renewed cooperation of the trade union movement, Labour will
continue the battle against rising prices. With the wholehearted backing of the
TUC, we have set ourselves a new target, to get inflation down to 5 per cent by
1982.
Our approach will be threefold:
Firstly, Labour will strengthen the Price Commission, giving it greater powers
to initiate investigations and reduce prices, in contrast to the Tories who
threaten its abolition. We will expand its powers to combine its functions with
those of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to ensure that consumers are not
exploited by monopoly producers or unfair practices. We will further strengthen
and extend consumer protection, in both the public and private sectors.
Secondly, Labour will seek radical reform of the Common Market's common
agricultural policy, and will oppose any further increases in common prices
until food surpluses have disappeared.
Thirdly, in contrast to the Tories' savage free-for-all which leads to soaring
inflation and industrial chaos, the Labour Government will work with the TUC to
achieve our agreed inflation target of 5 per cent in 1982. The Labour Government
and the TUC have jointly agreed to set up a standing commission on comparability
which will ensure that public sector workers, including those who are low-paid,
receive fair wages that are in line with those paid in the private sector.
For the private sector, we declare our aim to be a high wage, high productivity,
low unit cost economy. To this end, we pledge ourselves to make a reality of
fair deal collective bargaining, in keeping with the criteria set down in the
joint statement.
This agreement is a far better way of achieving industrial peace, prosperity and
more stable prices than confrontation with the trade union movement.
Here is an agreement which can deliver industrial peace, fair wages, and greater
price stability.
Jobs and Prosperity
In the major industrial nations of Europe and America, 17 million people are out
of work. In Britain alone we have to find jobs for 170,000 new workers every
year.
The Labour Government will pursue policies which give a high priority to the
return to full employment. This must go hand-in-hand with keeping down
inflation. We therefore aim at a rate of growth of 3 per cent or more.
Our North Sea oil gives us an advantage in securing full employment and a rise
in living standards. The new technologies also hold out the prospect of faster
growth and a better quality of life for all. This is particularly true of
microtechnologies (the silicon chip) which will have a major impact on the lives
of everybody. Only a Labour Government can ensure that our people as a whole
derive the benefit.
In order to take full advantage of these opportunities, we must improve our
industrial competitiveness at home and abroad - and that means making sure our
industries adapt to new markets and technological changes. It also means easing
the costs of rapid industrial change for working people. The use of crude market
forces advocated by the Tories will not and cannot achieve these changes in a
way that is acceptable to the British people. What we need is a firm industrial
and employment strategy from a Labour Government aimed at increasing
productivity, adding to investment, and creating new jobs.
We shall expand and improve programmes of training and retraining in skills.
We shall expand the work and finance of the National Enterprise Board, using
public ownership to sustain and create new jobs, and ensure that we get an
adequate return on our investment.
We shall continue our strong policy of regional incentives.
We shall expand the work of the Welsh and the Scottish Development Agencies. The
Labour Government will create similar development agencies in the English
regions suffering similar problems.
To ensure that private industry plays its full part in the drive for prosperity
and full employment, we shall conclude planning agreements with the major
industrial companies, with the necessary back-up statutory powers to do so. We
shall establish within Government the necessary arrangements to make this
effective.
We reaffirm the policy that we have pursued that wherever we give direct aid to
a company Out of public funds, we shall reserve the right to take a
proportionate share of the ownership of the company; and wherever possible, this
public support will be channelled through the planning agreement system.
Labour will continue with major aids to investment, including the selective
investment scheme which has already supported projects in excess of £1,000m.
Labour will develop the work and funding of the Cooperative Development Agency
in expanding cooperative enterprise.
This is a positive strategy for industry, based on cooperation between
Government, trade unions, and management. The new agreement between the
Government and the TUC, which includes provision for an agreed annual assessment
of the nation's economic prospects, lays the foundation for working together in
the 1980s.
Labour will work for an international agreement under which all countries are
helped and encouraged to expand their economies to the limit of their productive
capacity and so stimulate world trade. This will help British exports to
increase still faster. But to do this, Britain needs a healthy and expanding
economy.
We also need a programme to protect employment while the necessary changes and
modernization of our industry takes place. We will not allow our industries to
be wiped out by excessive imports before they have had a chance to recover their
strength. The Labour Government will ensure that imports enter our market only
within acceptable limits.
Under the Labour Government, we shall continue with programmes like the
short-time working compensation scheme, the job release scheme, the small firms
employment subsidy, and job creation programmes which have already created and
saved over one million jobs.
We do not accept that individuals whose jobs have disappeared should remain
unemployed for periods of time which demoralise them and impoverish their
families. We pledge ourselves to the progressive introduction of a scheme which
will ensure within the lifetime of the next Parliament that no one shall be
unemployed for more than 12 months without receiving either the offer of a job
or of retraining.
Labour will also promote an expansion in housing, the health service, education
and other social services which have such a crucial part to play in providing
jobs as well as in meeting vital social needs.
If full employment is to be achieved, longer holidays, time off for study,
earlier voluntary retirement, and a progressive move to a 35-hour working week,
must play an increasing role during the 1980s. But these changes in the pattern
of employment are not only necessary to keep jobs, but also to improve the
quality of living for working people, to give them more leisure and the means to
enjoy it to which their work and modern technology entitles them.
Labour must ensure that the financial institutions of this country play their
part in our programme for the revival of industry. We acknowledge the many
successes of the financial sector, but we are also concerned that the lure of
short-term profit can outweigh the social gains to be had from industrial
investment.
The banking sector would benefit from increased competition. We therefore intend
to bring about a major development in the Girobank so that it will compete on
equal terms with the big four clearing banks and improve standards of service to
small savers. The National Savings Bank has a valuable role to play in providing
a unique service and in making a significant contribution to financing the
Government's operations, thus reducing our reliance on the City. By developing
the Girobank and the National Savings Bank to their full potential, a Labour
Government will ensure for the country a vigorous public banking sector.
Agriculture and Fishing
Agriculture has always flourished best under Labour Governments. We have already
taken many steps to encourage production, while giving consumers and workers in
the industry the best possible deal. Agricultural workers in tied cottages have
been given security of tenure in England and Wales; we intend to do the same for
Scotland.
Elsewhere we give our proposals to reform the EEC's common agricultural policy.
There must also be a vigorous expansion of agriculture at home. Labour will:
Develop measures of special assistance to farmers on hill and marginal land.
Consider in the light of the official enquiry we have set up into agricultural
land, protection for farmers against the intrusion of financial institutions
into this field. Continue to demand a common fisheries policy that gives
preference in our own waters to a strong British fishing industry - betrayed by
the last Tory Government - with a secure future. We will continue to take, and
enforce, national measures to conserve stocks. We shall complete the process of
decasualisation in the industry.
Energy
The world energy situation is deteriorating. Energy policy is vitally important
to our survival. We shall strengthen the democratic planning of the long-term
developments of Britain's own energy sources, backed by the necessary powers,
under full parliamentary control.
Britain is almost alone among major industrial nations in achieving energy
self-sufficiency; our resources have been developed, thanks to the skills of our
scientists and of the workers. The Tories handed over our oil wealth to the
multinationals. We changed that and will ensure that this energy wealth is
developed wisely for industrial regeneration and public provision, and its
fruits distributed fairly.
We will continue to support Plan for Coal' for the mining industry, which has a
key role to play in our energy future.
In any programme for nuclear power, safety must continue to be the dominant
factor. Any such development would have to take place within the public sector.
We shall maintain strict safeguards over the disposal of nuclear waste. We have
not decided whether to build a commercial fast breeder reactor. A major study
and public inquiry would be held before any decision were to be taken.
We shall progressively increase the national stake in the North Sea, to
safeguard the British people and regenerate British industry.
We have initiated and will continue a major programme of alternative energy,
energy saving, through insulation grants, advice to industry, the 'Save-It'
campaign, and an energy-saving approach to transport.
We shall continue to help people to afford adequate light, heat, and power in
their homes.
A Fairer Britain
Economic success is not an end in itself. For the Labour Party, prosperity and
fairness march hand in hand on the road to a better Britain. During the next
Parliament, we intend to continue our fight against all forms of social
injustice.
The tax system must be fair and seen to be so. We will mount an all-out attack
on tax evasion. Everybody must make their fair contribution to the country's
finances. In the next Parliament, we shall introduce an annual wealth tax on the
small minority of rich people whose total net personal wealth exceeds £150,000.
Labour will continue to reduce the burden of income tax, and raise the tax
threshold below which people pay no income tax.
Despite the difficulties of the economic situation, Labour has kept its pledge
to look after the poor and vulnerable in our society - pensioners, the sick or
disabled people, and the unemployed. Pensions are up by 20 per cent in real
terms on the Tory level. Labour's new child benefit gives £4 a week per child
for every mother. Disabled people have new benefits: a non-contributory
invalidity pension, an invalid car allowance, and a mobility allowance for
people who cannot walk.
The Labour Government will build on our record of achievement. Labour will:
As a next step towards a married couple pension of half gross average earnings
and a single person's pension of one-third gross average earnings, increase
pensions in November to around £35 for a married couple and £22 for a single
person. Widows', invalidity and other long-term benefits will be increased in
line.
As a step towards meeting our objective that families get as much help for their
children when working as they do on short-term benefits, increase child benefit
to £4.50 in November as a next step towards further help.
Give further cash and other help to one-parent families. Raise the burial grant
to a more realistic level.
For disabled people, Labour will:
Work for the further implementation of Labour's Chronically Sick and Disabled
Persons Act.
Increase the mobility allowance again next November and continue to pay the
mobility allowance beyond pension age without an upper age limit.
Introduce a new disablement allowance to include the blind, varying according to
the severity of disablement.
A Healthier Nation
The nation's health must have priority. We reject Tory plans to create two
health services: one for the rich, financed by private insurance with a
second-class service for the rest of us. Labour reaffirms its belief in a
comprehensive national health service for all our people. We oppose Tory
proposals for higher prescription charges and charges for seeing a doctor or
being in hospital. Our aim is to abolish all charges in the NHS.
For all the talk of cuts, the truth is that the Labour Government are spending
over £600m a year more on health in real terms than the Tories. Labour will
devote a higher proportion of the nation's wealth to the health service and the
personal social services.
Labour's health priorities include a renewed shift from hospital treatment to
care in the community through family doctors and health centres with supporting
social services; a comprehensive family planning service within the NHS; more
emphasis on the prevention of illness and handicap; a fairer share of health
funds across the country; more help for the frail elderly, the mentally ill, and
handicapped; better training and opportunities for nurses and all workers in the
health services; a new career structure for hospital doctors; and a greater
recognition and reward to those consultants whose only professional commitment
is to the NHS.
We will streamline the bureaucratic and costly structure the Tories created and
give a bigger say in running the NHS to the public and staff.
We are phasing-out the remaining private beds in NHS hospitals. We shall stop
queue-jumping.
Education
The Labour Party believes in equality of opportunity. Universal comprehensive
education, which is central to our policy, must be completed in the 1980s.
Already class sizes are the lowest ever recorded. The ratio of pupils to
teachers is now only 23.6 in primary schools and 16.9 in secondary schools.
Labour will continue to give high priority to reducing class sizes further.
Independent schools still represent a major obstacle to equality of opportunity.
Labour's aim is to end, as soon as possible, fee-paying in such schools, while
safeguarding schools for the handicapped. Labour will end as soon as possible
the remaining public subsidies and public support to independent schools.
The Under-fives
Under this Labour Government, the proportion of 3- and 4-year-olds in nursery
classes and schools has doubled. Local authorities will be encouraged to do much
more. Our aim is to provide nursery education for 90 per cent of our 4-year-olds
and half of our 3-year-olds by the early 1980s.
The Needs of Youth
We will provide a universal scheme of education and training for all 16-19 year
olds, if necessary backed by statute. We will remove the financial barriers
which prevent many young people from low income families from continuing their
education after 16.
We will reintroduce legislation for income-related mandatory awards to all 16-18
year olds on all full-time courses.
Further and Higher Education
Further education places have increased by 25,000 under Labour. Labour will
substantially increase the opportunities for people from working-class
backgrounds -particularly adults - to enter further and higher education. We
want to see more workers given time off work for study. To this end, the places
at the Open University have increased from 42,000 in 1974 to 80,000 in 1978. We
propose to extend the present mandatory grant system. Labour supported the adult
literacy scheme, and will ensure its continuation.
Youth
Britain has the best youth programme in Europe. We have the youth opportunities
programme, which guarantees every school-leaver either a job or a training place
or employment experience. We are supporting a great range of opportunities for
young people. Labour will see the youth service expanded to meet the social and
recreational needs of young people.
Sport
In a society where leisure is increasing year by year, Labour wants to make
facilities for sport and leisure available to all. We will continue to put more
money into these activities.
Homes for All
Over 1.5 million homes have been completed since Labour took office. A further
one million sub-standard or near slum houses have been substantially improved
with Government finance, under the 1974 Housing Act. The homeless have had a new
deal. And yet too many of our people still live in unacceptable housing
conditions. We will continue a substantial programme of housebuilding and home
improvement.
Under our new system of housing investment programmes, local councils will
continue to play a central part in meeting housing needs.
We reject the philosophy that tenants are second-class citizens. Labour has
already published its new Housing Bill which will give a new deal to council
tenants to give them security of tenure; the right to a written tenancy
agreement; the right to improve the home; the right to take in lodgers; the
right to be consulted on housing management decisions; easier residential
qualifications; and a new national scheme to help tenants to move from one part
of the country to another.
We will improve the quality of our less popular council estates, which will mean
relaxing the rules under which improvements to estates less than 30 years old
cannot attract Government subsidy.
Labour does not oppose the sale of council houses to sitting tenants of two
years' standing who want to buy, so long as such sales are at a fair price and
do not damage a local authority's ability to meet the demands for decent homes
to rent. But Labour will continue to oppose the sales of council housing in
areas of serious housing need.
Labour also seeks to widen choice, and we shall therefore continue to help those
who wish to buy their own homes.
Labour will:
Carry through its new home loan plan to give saving bonuses and interest-free
loans of up to £600 to first-time buyers.
Examine ways of expanding the scheme under which building societies lend to
home-buyers nominated by local councils, particularly for older, cheaper
properties.
Introduce new ways of lowering the cost and speeding the process of house
purchase. Labour has set up the Royal Commission on Legal Services, which will
be reporting on conveyancing. Labour policy is to end the monopoly on house
conveyancing now enjoyed by solicitors, and improve leasehold enfranchisement.
With the growth of home ownership and council housing, private renting has
entered an irreversible decline. We stand by the principles of security of
tenure and rent regulations, and will legislate to close loopholes in the Rent
Acts. We shall continue to encourage socially-accountable landlords - local
authorities, housing associations and housing cooperatives - to take over
privately rented property except where an owner-occupier lets part of his own
home.
Labour will give private tenants access to improvement grants on the same basis
as owners. We shall make it easier for a tenant to force a landlord to do
necessary repairs. We will legislate to give further protection to those who
live in mobile homes and to the owners of holiday caravans. We will set up a new
housing tribunal to replace the present confusing jumble of courts, tribunals
and committees dealing with rents, security of tenure, and other housing
problems.
Labour will give new rights to everyone whose home is tied to their job.
Building and Our Future
A well-organized and efficient construction industry is essential to the
achievement of many of our economic and social objectives. Labour will:
Plan and coordinate public sector demand on the industry, in order to help
stabilize the industry's workload.
Press forward with plans for decasualization and job security in the industry,
building on the work of the Construction Industry Manpower Board, and giving
their proposed registration scheme statutory backing if necessary.
Encourage the development of building workers' cooperatives.
Expand local authority direct labour organizations, ensuring that they are
efficiently run as separate municipal enterprises, publicly accountable for
their performance.
Develop and strengthen existing building capacity in the public sector so as to
establish pace-making public enterprise for large and medium sized construction
projects.
Labour and The Land
At the heart of all planning policy is the problem of the land. Labour's
Community Land Act provides the means to tackle land speculation through public
ownership. We shall seek to clarify and amend the regulations surrounding land
valuation, not least to ensure that land is valued very much more closely to its
present use value. We shall use it to ensure that social criteria rather than
maximum profit decides how land is to be used. We intend to set up a publicly
accessible register of all land.
We will authorize local authorities to charge rates on land which is left
unused. We have simplified planning procedures. We intend that in future
planning permissions not acted upon after five years will not be automatically
renewed.
The Inner City
Labour is committed to save our inner cities. With the inner city partnerships,
the new
Urban Area Act, and the increased urban programme, Labour has begun to breathe
new life into our inner cities.
First, we must bring back more jobs to these areas. Our national industrial
policy will be used to bring investment to the inner cities. We will mount a
concerted effort to stimulate the development of small firms and worker
cooperatives in these areas.
Secondly, we will bring about during the lifetime of the next Parliament a
further increase in the expenditure earmarked for refurbishing our inner cities,
for education, for housing, and for the social services.
Rural Areas
The Labour Government will take measures to arrest the decline in the quality of
life in rural areas. We will increase the funds available to the Development
Commission, and widen its scope. We will reestablish the Rural Development
Boards in England and ensure that the Co-operative Development Agency, the NEB,
the tourist boards and the Manpower Services Commission play an active role in
rural job creation. We shall encourage new forms of agriculture - such as fish
farming.
Recognizing the importance of an adequate integrated rural transport service, we
will provide greater support for rural buses, encourage improvements in the
frequency and timetabling of conventional services, and open freight rail lines
to passenger services.
We will improve and increase public sector housing in rural areas and improve
their educational facilities and personal social services.
Our Environment
Labour is proud of its record on environmental matters. Our Standing Royal
Commission on Environmental Pollution has set the pace for advance. For the
future, however, we will have to give still higher priority to this important
issue.
Labour will:
Develop policies for resource conservation.
Use our campaign for a better environment to provide the basis of secured
employment, eg in pollution control and in waste recycling.
Further reduce the lead content in petrol.
Provide an annual State of the Environment' report to Parliament. Ensure that,
before the inquiry stage of major development proposals - perhaps two or three a
year - the environmental effects are subject to detailed analysis and the report
published.
Introduce an extended clean-up campaign - 'Making Britain Clean and Green', and
start a real drive by local authorities and voluntary groups to clear up
derelict land, and use it to the benefit of the community.
Transport
The majority of our people still depend on public transport. Labour believes in
maintaining and improving within an integrated transport system. We will
encourage closer coordination at local level between road and rail.
Railways
Under Labour, there will never be another Beeching. We will maintain the present
rail network and increase investment in the future. As much freight as possible
must be carried by rail; and the scheme whereby companies receive grants for
installing railway facilities will be extended.
Buses, especially in country areas, will continue to require a permanent and
substantial amount of public support to meet social needs. In areas where free
travel does not yet exist, Labour will bring in a nationwide, off-peak,
half-fares scheme for OAPs, the blind and the disabled.
We will sort out the present confusion surrounding arrangements for children's
fares, so that there are free fares up to the age of five, and reduced fares up
to 16. Those benefiting from the present free travel to school schemes will not
be affected.
For the motorist, we want to reduce bureaucracy and ensure fair treatment. The
phased abolition of vehicle excise duty will remove one source of annoyance and
irritation. Labour will press for major improvements for customers in motorway
service areas and garage repairs generally.
Heavy lorries will be made to carry, through taxation, their full share of road
costs, including environmental costs. We will take further measures to reduce
noise and pollution. The National Freight Corporation must be enabled to provide
the basis for expanding the public sector in the road haulage industry. The
Labour Government will continue to oppose any proposals to increase the
permitted maximum weight limit for heavy lorries, which are inconsistent with
road safety and the needs of the environment.
The road building programme will remain at its present level - but we will adopt
a more selective approach than in the past. More by-passes will be built.
Highway inquiries will also be more open, wider in scope, and with inspectors
clearly seen to be independent.
In the ports industry, we reaffirm our policy to bring commercial ports and
cargo handling into public ownership.
A Wider, More Open Democracy
A central theme of our programme for the eighties is the protection and
enhancement of
our democracy.
Democracy at Work
The time has come to recognize the increasing desire of employees to have a
larger say in the decisions which vitally affect their working lives and jobs.
We also wish to harness their energies and experience in a positive partnership
to improve our industrial relationships in a way which reduced conflict and
increased cooperation. We therefore commit the Labour Government to a major
extension of industrial democracy. Democratic practice and good industrial
relations means single status in industry and a dignified respect for all
workers, whatever their plant grading.
We recognize - as have other countries - that employees should be entitled to
fall back on certain basic rights if agreement is not achieved. To this end, we
will encourage recognized trade unions to establish joint representation
committees in all companies employing more than 500 people, and place a legal
obligation on employers to discuss company plans with these committees. We will
establish an industrial democracy commission to stimulate and monitor schemes of
industrial democracy in the private sector and nationalised industries.
Devolution
In our 1974 manifesto, we promised to create elected assembles in Scotland and
Wales as part of our programme of decentralization and devolution of power.
Following the result of the referendum in Wales, it is clear that the majority
there does not want an assembly, and we accept their decision. In Scotland,
however, a majority voted for devolution.
We reaffirm our commitment to devolution for Scotland. We are therefore ready to
discuss constructively with all concerned any changes which would make the
scheme in the present Act more widely acceptable, so that we can establish a
Scottish Assembly.
Law, Rights and the Community
The protection and enhancement of human rights and civil liberties is an
indispensable part of a wider democracy. We will fight against crime and
violence which affect all Western societies. We will continue to back the police
with proper resources and manpower. The police are substantially better-paid and
equipped today than they were under the Tories. At the same time, we shall
attack the social deprivation which allows crime to flourish.
Our policies on fighting deprivation and social injustice, on arresting the
decay of our inner cities, on youth employment and helping the family, will all
contribute to a happier and more law-abiding society.
During the next Parliament, we will increase law centres providing legal help
for the ordinary citizen; provide more resources for the prison and probation
services; extend legal aid to certain tribunal hearings; bring together and
coordinate the various offices of Ombudsmen; consider responsibility for the
conduct of prosecutions in the light of the report of the Royal Commission on
Criminal Procedures; and provide further help for the victims of crime.
Democracy at Westminster
In central government, we will:
Make major improvements in the legislative process, including new methods of
considering Bills in committee, and of scrutinizing the work of government
through select committees.
Establish a more powerful and professional system of audit.
Introduce a Freedom of Information Bill to provide a system of open government,
and enact the proposals made by the Government in its White Paper to reform
Section Two of the Official Secrets Act.
Bring forward proposals to reform the machinery of government and the structure
of public administration to bring them into line with modern conditions.
Reexamine the procedures for appointment to governmental and quasi-governmental
bodies, and to the boards of public enterprises, and for recommendations for
honours.
No one can defend on any democratic grounds the House of Lords and the power and
influence it exercises in our constitution. We propose, therefore, in the next
Parliament, to abolish the delaying power and legislative veto of the House of
Lords.
Local Democracy
Already, the central government pays 61 per cent of the cost of most local
services. We shall continue through the rate support grant to provide national
Exchequer assistance to ratepayers, particularly in areas of greatest need. We
shall seek ways of making finance for local government fairer to ratepayers.
Labour will extend public involvement in local government, so damaged by the
bureaucratic and costly local government system imposed by the Tories.
To this end, the Labour Government will:
Give back to large district councils in England responsibility for education,
planning, social services, local libraries and other local services.
Equality for Women
Labour's Sex Discrimination Act, Equal Pay Act, the Employment Protection Act,
and
Social Security Pensions Act have already created a new deal for women.
Disabled housewives, single mothers, women looking after a dependent relative
-all have received help from this Labour Government.
We have made a start towards equal citizenship by giving to British women,
married to foreign husbands, the same rights as British men with foreign wives.
We have changed the regulations to make it possible for children born abroad to
British mothers to acquire British nationality.
We shall progressively eliminate the inequalities that still exist in the social
security and tax systems. We shall introduce further reforms proposed by the
Finer Committee on One-Parent Families. We have already protected the anonymity
of women victims of rape. We shall bring in a fairer system of family law with
new family courts. Labour will abolish the contributory conditions for maternity
grant and raise the level of the grant.
One community
Labour has already strengthened the legislation protecting minorities. The next
Labour
Government will continue to protect the community against discrimination and
racialism. We will:
Give a strong lead, by promoting equality of opportunities at work throughout
the public sector.
Help those whose first language is not English.
Monitor all Government and local authority services to ensure that minorities
are receiving fair treatment.
Consider what measures may be necessary to clarify the role of the Public Order
Act and to strengthen and widen the scope of the Race Relations Act.
Review the 1824 Vagrancy Act, with a view to the repeal of Section 4.
Large-scale migration to this country is ending, but we still have some major
commitments to fulfil. Labour will honour these. A quota would merely cause even
longer delays for dependants.
Our whole immigration and citizenship law needs revision. Progress has already
been made on this with the publication of a Government Green Paper.
Northern Ireland
For over four years, Labour has governed Northern Ireland direct from
Westminster. During this period, considerable progress has been made on the
security front and on the efforts to bring peace and stability to the Province.
Detention has been ended, a special independent Police Complaints Board has been
set up, and the police themselves are now more widely accepted in the community.

Unfortunately, in spite of all the attempts by the Labour Government, it has not
been possible to find common agreement between the political parties on the best
form of government for Northern Ireland.
For the present, direct rule remains the only viable alternative. Any change can
be made only with the consent of the people of Northern Ireland. We will work to
make it more accountable and democratic.
In the field of security, there is an essential role for the army in protecting
the people of Northern Ireland, but we will continue our policy of extending the
role of the police so as to involve all sections of the community.
We accept the recommendations of the Bennett Committee, and we will see that
they are carried out as quickly as possible to make ill-treatment impossible.
Labour has saved thousands of jobs in Northern Ireland and attracted much
investment and industry to the most under-developed areas. But at about twice
the United Kingdom average, unemployment continues at an intolerably high level.
The industrial policies set out earlier will be applied with full force and
vigour to Northern Ireland.
The Arts and the Media
Both the arts and the media play an important role in enhancing the quality of
our democracy.
Arts. Aid to the Arts Council is going up 25 per cent this year. We will ensure
more money for the Arts in future. The Arts Council should include elected
representatives.
A Labour Government will set up a British Film Authority, with a distribution
arm to stimulate investment in British film productions.
The media. Our aim is to safeguard freedom of expression; to encourage
diversity; and to guard both against the dangers of government and of commercial
control.
On broadcasting, the Labour Government will implement the proposals in its White
Paper, including instituting an Open Broadcasting Authority. We will phase out
the television licence fee for old age pensioners during the lifetime of the
next Parliament.
Animal Welfare
Under Labour's new council of animal welfare, we will have stronger control on
the export of live animals for slaughter, and conditions of factory farming, and
experiments on living animals.
Legislation to end cruelty to animals will include the banning of hare coursing,
stag and deer hunting. Angling and shooting will in no way be affected by our
proposals.
European Community
At this election, Labour will, once again, be the only major political party to
offer the British people the prospect of bringing about fundamental and
much-needed reform to the EEC.
We are concerned to ensure that Greece, Portugal, and Spain receive an early
welcome into the Community. This enlargement of the Community will provide an
opportunity to create a wider and looser grouping of European states, thus
reducing the dangers of an over-centralised and over-bureaucratic EEC.
We aim to develop a Europe which is democratic and socialist, and where the
interests of the people are placed above the interests of national and
multinational capitalist groups, but within which each country must be able to
realize its own economic and social objectives, under the sovereignty of its own
Parliament and people.
A Labour Government will oppose any move towards turning the Community into a
federation.
Trade and Industry
Working with our socialist colleagues, we will defend the ability of each member
state to determine its own industrial policies. Our policy is to encourage such
measures as import ceilings and orderly marketing arrangements where they are
necessary to protect vital national economic interests.
Member states must be able to control and plan their own energy policies while
at the same time maximizing cooperation and seeking agreement on areas of mutual
interest, such as research and development.
Food and Agriculture
Membership of the Community has compelled us to pay more for our food than
otherwise would be the case. The CAP raises serious problems for British
agriculture -distorting the balance of production; decreasing consumption
through inflated prices in the shops; and stopping the industry from growing.
That is why Labour seeks a fundamental reform of the CAP.
The Tories back a policy which would raise food prices by the equivalent of £90
a year on the average family budget.
Labour will seek to:
End the scandal of food surpluses - which cost £900m per year in storage alone.
Improve access for cheap food from countries outside the EEC.
Reduce EEC support prices; and press for more scope under the CAP for national
support arrangements, such as our beef premiums.
A change in emphasis from price support to structural reform.
The reforms we are calling for are in the interests of consumers throughout
every country in the Community. We will do our utmost to gain the cooperation of
our EEC partners. However, if these reforms are not speedily implemented, we
shall protect our interests - if necessary vetoing any further increase in food
prices until surpluses have been eliminated.
Economy and Finance
We will retain the freedom to determine our own budgetary policy and to control
our own currency. A Labour Government will retain the power to impose controls
on capital movements and will continue to resist any upward harmonisation of VAT
or any reduction in the existing range of zero-rated VAT items in Britain. A
Labour Government would not join an economic and monetary union.
The Community Budget
Major reforms are needed to the Community Budget. Britain is now providing a net
subsidy to some of the other EEC countries amounting to £900m a year. No country
whose national income falls below the average for the Community as a whole
should be required to make a net contribution to the Budget.
We should reduce the proportion (75 per cent) of the Community Budget spent on
agriculture, and the funds so released could be directed into social and
regional development.
The Labour Government will ensure that the Community Budget should promote a
fairer distribution of resources within the EEC, and the convergence of economic
performance of member states, to achieve faster growth, higher employment and
lower rates of inflation.
Parliamentary Sovereignty
The Labour Government will legislate to ensure that British ministers are
accountable to the House of Commons before making any commitment in the Council
of Ministers. Enlargement of the Community will provide the opportunity for
seeking changes in the Treaty of Rome, which would enable the House of Commons
to strengthen its powers to amend or repeal EEC legislation. This would involve
consequential amendments to the 1972 European Communities Act.
The Third World
The Labour Government will press for improvements in the Lome Convention, for
widening the scope of the EEC's aid to include the most needy areas of the
world, and for the EEC to place emphasis on trade and the stabilization of the
export prices of third world commodities.
Foreign Policy
The Labour Party's priority is to build a democratic socialist society in
Britain and to create the conditions necessary to free the world from poverty,
inequality and war. We condemn violations of human rights wherever they occur
and whatever the political complexion of the Government concerned, and will
further human rights in all international organizations.
Crucial to our policy is the pursuit of peace, development and disarmament by
strengthening the process of détente. We shall seek to improve relations with
the USSR and the countries of Eastern Europe, as well as with China.
We shall continue to work for the peaceful and just settlement of disputes and
the strengthening of international cooperation. The Labour Government will,
therefore, continue its policy of strengthening international organizations,
particularly the United Nations, and the Commonwealth.
We shall continue to work to bring about a just settlement of the problems of
Cyprus.
We shall work for a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Arab conflict which
would ensure the right of all parties to achieve national self-determination and
to live in a homeland within secure and recognized borders.
Labour is totally opposed to the system of apartheid, and will continue to
support opponents of apartheid, giving humanitarian and other aid to liberation
movements of southern Africa. Labour believes that it is not only wrong, but
contrary to British long-term interests, to be closely tied economically to
South Africa. We will take active steps to reduce our economic dependence on
South Africa and discourage new investment in South Africa by British companies.
Those already operating there will be expected to comply with a strengthened
code of conduct governing conditions of employment.
We have refused to approve the Rhodesian internal settlement and we will
continue to work for a settlement of the Rhodesia problem acceptable to the
people of Rhodesia as a whole. Until such time as an agreement is arrived at, we
will maintain and intensify sanctions against the illegal regime.
We will continue actively to support the United Nations settlement proposals for
Namibia, including upholding the territorial integrity of the country.
In respect of those countries of Latin America with dictatorial regimes,
particularly Chile and Argentina, the Labour Government will demand that these
regimes pay promptly their due debts. The restoration of human and trade union
rights will be a prior condition for the rescheduling of future debt payments.
We will continue to pursue our policy of aid to the poorest countries and the
poorest people, with the emphasis on rural development. Under Labour, aid is
increasing at 6 per cent a year.
We will seek to implement the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of the gross
national product for official aid as soon as economic circumstances permit.
Labour will take account of human rights considerations when giving aid.
Help will continue to be given to the victims of repressive regimes, including
the provision of refugee programmes.
The Labour Government approach the North-South dialogue in a spirit of
cooperation. It will actively participate in the UNCTAD 5 and other negotiations
seeking to establish a more just world trading system which recognizes the needs
of poorer countries.
Détente and Defence
While actively pursuing a policy of détente, the Labour Government will continue
to press for the implementation of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki
Final Act. The Labour Government will continue to work for the success of the
Mutual Balanced Force Reduction Talks in Vienna, and will give full support to
the work of the United Nations Committee on Disarmament. The Labour Government
will work for the speedy conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We shall
also give every encouragement to our American allies to achieve a successful
conclusion to the vital Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. The Labour Government
will maintain its support for Nato as an instrument of détente no less than of
defence. The ultimate objective of a satisfactory relationship in Europe is the
mutual and concurrent phasing-out of both Nato and the Warsaw Pact.
We shall continue with our plans to reduce the proportion of the nation's
resources devoted to defence, so that the burden we bear will be brought into
line with that carried by our main allies. A Labour Government would plan to
ensure that savings in military expenditure did not lead to unemployment for
those working in the defence industries. We shall give material support and
encouragement to plans for industrial conversion so that the valuable resources
of the defence industries can be used for the production of socially-needed
goods.
In 1974, we renounced any intention of moving towards the production of a new
generation of nuclear weapons or a successor to the Polaris nuclear force; we
reiterate our belief that this is the best course for Britain. But many great
issues affecting our allies and the world are involved, and a new round of
strategic arms limitation negotiations will soon begin. We think it is essential
that there must be a full and informed debate about these issues in the country
before the necessary decision is taken.
Labour will give every encouragement to those working for the cause of
international peace. We will consider establishing a peace research institute.
We shall negotiate with our friends and allies, to prevent the supply of arms to
countries where any such supply would increase the chances of international
conflict or internal repression.
Into the Eighties
This election comes at a time of change. unparalleled since 1945. A generation
has now grown up in a welfare state which remains the envy of the world in
health care and education. We have demonstrated a capacity for skill and
inventiveness which keeps us at the forefront of world technology. Those are no
mean achievements.
A Tory Government would put all this at risk. At work, they would substitute
confrontation for cooperation. The free market forces they support would mean
soaring inflation, rising prices and growing unemployment. Their uncaring
meanness would mean misery for millions of the most vulnerable in our community,
for their policy of cutting public expenditure can only mean a drastic reduction
in all our social services.
Against this reactionary prospect, Labour sets its vision for the future. We
seek to bring about a fundamental change in the balance of power and wealth in
favour of working people and their families. We reject the concept that there is
a choice to be made between a prosperous and efficient Britain and a caring and
compassionate society. As democratic socialists, we believe they complement each
other.
That is the spirit of this manifesto. A strong, fair, and more just society is
the prize within our grasp. It is the message of hope for the future, based on a
record of promises kept, that Labour puts to the British people at this
election.

Foreword
Here you can read Labour's plan to do the things crying out to be done in our
country today.
To get Britain back to work. To rebuild our shattered industries. To get rid of
the ever-growing dole queues. To protect and enlarge our National Health Service
and our other great social services. To help stop the nuclear arms race. Here
you can see what Labour is determined to do, and how we shall set about it.
But at once the objection is raised: Can we afford it? Where will the money come
from? Are we not just making promises which cannot be fulfilled?
You will find the detailed answers here. But let us emphasise a few of them at
once.
The first short, sharp answer is that what Britain cannot afford is the present
policy of accepting mass unemployment.
Mass unemployment on the scale Mrs. Thatcher and her government have been
prepared to tolerate - worse than we have ever known before and worse than any
other industrial country has experienced - imposes a crushing burden on the
whole community.
Of course it hits hardest the young denied work altogether, and their mothers
and fathers thrown out of their jobs with little chance of getting another.
But it also hits the whole country.
Mass unemployment costs the country &pound;15 billion, &pound;16 billion,
&pound;17 billion a year, astronomic figures never conceived possible before,
and they move higher still every month.
Mass unemployment is the main reason why most families in Britain, all but the
very rich, are paying more in taxes today than they did four years ago when the
Conservatives promised to cut them for everybody.
Mass unemployment is the main reason why we are wasting our precious North Sea
oil riches. Since 1979 Mrs. Thatcher's government has had the benefit of
&pound;20 billion in tax revenues from the North Sea. It has all been swallowed
by the huge, mounting cost of mass unemployment. And the oil won't last for
ever, although, according to Mrs. Thatcher's economics, the unemployment will.
Our country, no civilised country, can afford the human waste, the industrial
and economic waste, involved in these policies. We in the Labour Party reject
them absolutely, and we describe in this Manifesto the real constructive
alternative, and how we shall pay for it.
See, first, our Emergency Programme of Action to be started immediately we are
given the power. Most of these measures are designed to start the drive for
expansion, and the cost of them has been added up. How fast can the country
escape for the present stagnant rut?
That is the real question.
Just a week before Sir Geoffrey Howe, the Tory Chancellor, produced his last
Budget to keep us in the rut, Peter Shore, Labour's Shadow Chancellor, produced
his budget for expansion.
The costs he set out - an &pound;11 billion expansion - would cover, as they
were designed to cover, the items we have listed in the Emergency Programme, the
promises we have tabulated.
So little is it true that Labour has not counted the cost. No party in
opposition has ever stated its intentions so clearly and comprehensively.
Then what happens? What happens after the first expansion is launched? Here in
these pages we describe the conditions for success, the pace we can move
forward, how that will depend on the response we can secure from all sections of
the community, on the partnership we have established with the trade unions.
Without that continuing partnership to rebuild our country, all else will fail.
True enough; but Labour is the only party which has worked for this partnership
and pledges it for the future.
And where will the money come from? Some of it will come from those oil revenues
now pouring down the drain. Some of it will come from the billions we waste on
the dole queues. Some of it will come from the billions now being allowed to be
exported in investment abroad.
Yes, and some of it will be borrowed, Mrs. Thatcher's dirty word.
But borrowing in that sense is what every intelligent government since the war
in Britain has done - including even Conservative governments. Borrowing in that
sense is what has been done by other governments in this world slump who have
kept their unemployment much lower than ours - and their inflation rates low
too.
Of course the slump can be beaten, if we have the will and the right policies.
The European governments which have survived it best have been mostly socialist
governments rejecting Thatcherite nostrums. And the whole wider experience of
the Western world since 1945 proves what can be done when governments set before
them full employment as a target. Is it truly realistic and practical to cast
all that knowledge aside?
It is just not true that mass unemployment must be accepted.
Rather, if nothing can be done about unemployment, nothing truly enduring can be
done about anything else. Allow it to persist and it will corrode the rest of
our society. It will make more deeply endemic than ever the injustices, the
bitter hardships, which afflict so many of our people.
So let's put a stop to defeatism, and put a stop too to all those sermons about
Victorian values. The labour movement - the Labour Party and the trade unions
acting together - came into being, as one of our poets, Idris Davies, said, to
end ""the long Victorian night"". It was a fight to introduce civilised standards
into the world of ruthless, devil-take-the-hindmost individualism.
Particularly after our 1945 victory, when Labour had a majority, we set to work
creating a real community in which the strong would come to the aid of the weak,
in which the profit test would have to make way for the human test.
It was the Labour Party which created - to take just one example - the National
Health Service, in the teeth of bitter Tory opposition. Labour will come to the
rescue of that service and make it worthy of those who founded it, those who
serve it, and the patients who need it most of all. It is a commonsense example
of democratic socialism in action.
Of course, we know that the full work of rebuilding will not be easy. Of course
we know that, thanks to world conditions and the Conservative years of
destruction and decay, our task is made much harder.
But the programme of socialist reconstruction outlined in these pages, can be
carried through if a Labour government commands the support of the other great
democratic institutions in the land - in particular the local authorities and
the trade unions.
Labour is the only party which desires and can secure the working partnership
between the government and the trade unions essential to national recovery.
Above all, the new Labour government will play a much more ambitious part in
helping to guide the nation towards peace, and, as an essential part of the
process, in establishing a sensible defence policy for our country.
One bunch of smears and scares with which Tory propagandists have already
disfigured this election campaign suggests that the Labour Party proposes to
throw away our defences, to abandon our alliances.
It is just not true. And it should not be forgotten that one of the last acts of
Mrs. Thatcher's government was to stop the debate in the House of Commons when
these slanders could have been nailed.
What we do propose to do is to get rid of the nuclear boomerangs which offer no
genuine protection to our people but, first and foremost, to help stop the
nuclear arms race which is the most dangerous threat to us all.
One of the most wretched features of the present government's record has been
the low interest they have devoted to the work of securing international
disarmament. No British initiative of any significance in this field has been
taken.
Instead, the programme for establishing American-controlled Cruise missiles on
our soil has been accepted without question, and the Trident programme for the
expansion of the British-controlled nuclear forces has been accepted without
reference to the possibilities of disarmament.
Indeed, the logic of the case for the nuclear deterrent, presented by British
Conservative Ministers, is that all peace-loving countries should equip
themselves with the same protection. It is a logic which would intensify the
race and destroy the universe.
The first task of a new Labour government will be to restore a sense of sanity
in dealing with these supreme questions. We offer a combined programme of action
by this country and of action in association with other countries.
We are the only party that offers such a programme to meet the scale of the
challenge. We are the only party that offers a non-nuclear defence policy.
But we are not alone in our plans and our aspirations. Multitudes of people in
many other lands, on both sides of the Atlantic, in Asia and Africa and Europe
too, are ready to join us in the campaign for a nuclear freeze, for fresh
exertions to stop the proliferation of these weapons, to stop the whole
monstrous nuclear race to destruction.
Michael Foot



In this campaign document we set out Labour's alternative to mass unemployment.
We explain how a Labour government will help to stop the nuclear arms race. We
provide a radical programme of action, for a full, five-year parliament, to save
British industry and rebuild the welfare state.



The years of Tory failure
When the Tories took office in May 1979, unemployment was falling and the
economy growing. Living standards had gone up by a sixth in two years, and North
Sea oil held out the prospect of economic growth, high levels of employment and
better social services.
All this was thrown away by the Tories. Nearly three and a quarter million men
and women are now out of work, even on the official count. Plant after plant
forced to close. Manufacturing production down by a fifth. Investment cut by a
third. Our domestic markets captured by imports of manufactured goods.
After four years of Mrs. Thatcher, Britain is a poorer country. We have fared
far worse than any other major industrial country. The unprecedented advantage
of North Sea oil and gas - worth, in tax revenues alone, 8p in the pound on
income tax - has been squandered, with nothing whatsoever to show for it.
What have all these sacrifices achieved? Our economy today is weaker, not
stronger, than in 1979. There is no prospect of real economic growth. Indeed,
the Tories no longer dare to predict when unemployment will begin to fall. True
enough, inflation, after being forced to record levels by the Tories, has been
brought down. But look at the cost in jobs, in poorer housing, in living
standards, and in lost opportunities for our youth. And now inflation is set to
increase again, with interest rates and mortgage rates likely to rise too.
The legacy of four Tory years goes beyond unemployment and industrial decline;
beyond the damage done to our social services; beyond even the dangerous
commitment to new nuclear weapons. It is expressed in the deep sense of
bitterness, distrust and despair now felt among so many sections of the
community. Our task will be to heal these wounds and rekindle among the British
people a new sense of unity and common purpose.



Emergency programme of action
Within days of taking office, Labour will begin to implement an emergency
programme of action, to bring about a complete change of direction for Britain.
Our priority will be to create jobs and give a new urgency to the struggle for
peace. In many cases we will be able to act immediately. In others, which
involve legislation, they will take longer to bring into effect. But in all
cases we shall act swiftly and with determination.
This is what we plan to do. We will:
  Launch a massive programme for expansion. We will:
    Provide a major increase in public investment, including transport, housing
    and energy conservation.
    Begin a huge programme of construction, so that we can start to build our
    way out of the slump.
    Halt the destruction of our social services and begin to rebuild them, by
    providing a substantial increase in resources.
    Increase investment in industry, especially in new technology - with public
    enterprise taking the lead. And we will steer new industry and jobs to the
    regions and the inner cities.
    Ensure that the pound is competitive; and hold back prices through action on
    VAT, rents, rates and fares.
    Introduce a crash programme of employment and training, with new job
    subsidies and allowances.
  Begin to rebuild British industry, working within a new framework for planning
  and industrial democracy. We will:
    Agree a new national economic assessment, setting out the prospects for
    growth in the economy.
    Prepare a five-year national plan, in consultation with unions and
    employers. Back up these steps with a new National Investment Bank, new
    industrial powers, and a new Department for Economic and Industrial
    Planning.
    Repeal Tory legislation on industrial relations and make provision for
    introducing industrial democracy.
    Begin the return to public ownership of those public industries sold off by
    the Tories.
  Start to create a fairer Britain, with decent social services for all. We
  will:
    Raise child benefits by &pound;2 a week, and give special help to one-parent
    families and families with disabled dependants.
    Uprate the pension in November 1983 by the full amount needed to protect
    against inflation; and increase pensions by &pound;1.45 a week for a single
    person and &pound;2.25 for a married couple.
    Provide more resources for the health service with an increase of at least 3
    per cent a year in real terms.
    Improve the personal social services, such as meals on wheels and home
    helps, with an increase of at least 4 per cent a year in real terms.
    Spend more on education, including on essential books and equipment; end the
    assisted places scheme; and stop selection in secondary schools.
    Begin to develop comprehensive care for the under-fives.
    Begin to develop a strategy to eliminate low pay.
  Introduce positive action programmes to promote women's rights and
  opportunities, and appoint a cabinet minister to promote equality between the
  sexes. We will:
    Strengthen the Equal Pay Act and the Sex Discrimination Act.
    Improve child care and other social services.
    Take steps to end discrimination in education and training.
    Reverse Tory cuts in maternity rights.
    Increase the maternity grant.
  Encourage and assist local authorities to begin a massive programme of
  house-building and improvement, through an immediate 50 per cent increase in
  their housing investment programmes. Priority will go to the urgent repair and
  replacement of run-down estates. We will freeze all rents for the first full
  year.
  Begin a major programme to stop the waste of energy. We will stop Sizewell and
  abandon the Tory PWR programme; and open urgent discussions, with the unions
  and management in the coal industry, on a new Plan for Coal.
  Give more help to public transport, with funds to improve services, keep down
  fares, and increase investment - especially in rail electrification and better
  freight facilities. Councils will be given new powers to support local
  services.
  Act to improve the environment and deal with pollution - including a ban on
  lead in petrol. An urgent start will be made on improving our inner cities,
  including action on derelict land and buildings.
  Introduce a positive action programme for the ethnic minorities. We will also
  introduce citizenship and immigration laws which do not discriminate against
  either women or black and Asian Britons.
  Give a new priority to open government at local and national levels, and give
  local communities greater freedom to manage their own affairs. We will also
  introduce an early Bill to abolish the legislative powers of the House of
  Lords.
  In international policy, we shall take new initiatives to promote peace and
  development. We will:
    Cancel the Trident programme, refuse to deploy Cruise missiles and begin
    discussions for the removal of nuclear bases from Britain, which is to be
    completed within the lifetime of the Labour government.
    Ban arms sales to repressive regimes.
    Increase aid to developing countries towards the UN target of 0.7 per cent.
    Re-establish a separate Ministry of Overseas Development.
    Take action to protect the status of refugees in Britain.
  We will also open immediate negotiations with our EEC partners, and introduce
  the necessary legislation, to prepare for Britain's withdrawal from the EEC,
  to be completed well within the lifetime of the Labour government.


A five-year programme
Labour's emergency programme of action will get Britain on the road to recovery.
But on its own it will not be enough to establish a fairer, more prosperous,
more caring Britain.
The programme we set out in the pages which follow is, therefore, for a full,
five-year term of office. Clearly, we cannot do everything at once. The economy
has been dangerously weakened by the Tories, and Britain is considerably poorer
than when we were last in government. The world recession could hamper our plans
for economic revival.
Moreover, our proposals add up to a considerable increase in public spending.
Our programme is thus heavily dependent upon the achievement of our basic
objectives: namely, a large and sustained increase in the nation's output and
income and a matching decline in the numbers out of work. It is this that will
make the resources available for higher public spending programmes and cut the
enormous cost of unemployment. Even so, some of our commitments will be phased
in over a number of years. At each stage, clearly, we shall have to choose
carefully our priorities.
Ending mass unemployment
The present hideous level of unemployment is not an accident It is the direct
result of the policies of this government. The Tories have cut public investment
and services, and increased taxes, taking spending power out of the economy and
destroying jobs in both public and private sectors alike. They have forced up
interest rates and kept the pound too high - a combination that has crippled
British industry, and helped lose us markets at home and abroad.
Our approach is different. We will expand the economy, by providing a strong and
measured increase in spending. Spending money creates jobs. Money spent on
railway electrification means jobs, not only in construction, but also in the
industries that supply the equipment - as well as faster and better trains. If
we increase pensions and child benefits, it means more spending power for the
elderly and for parents, more bought in shops, more orders for goods, and more
jobs in the factories. More spending means that the economy will begin to
expand: and growth will provide the new wealth for higher wages and better
living standards, the right climate for industry to invest, and more resources
for the public services.
Our central aim will be to reduce unemployment to below a million within five
years of taking office. We recognise the enormous scale of this task. When we
set this as our target, unemployment was 2.8 million, according to the official
figures. On this basis it is now at least 3.2 million. Our target will thus be
all the more difficult to achieve. It remains, however, the central objective of
our economic policy.
To achieve it we will need five years of economic growth, with a Labour
government carrying through all of the industrial, financial and economic
policies outlined here. But we will also work with other governments -
especially socialist governments - to bring about a co-ordinated expansion of
our economies.
Economic expansion will make it possible to end the waste of mass unemployment.
But it will also reduce the human costs of unemployment - the poverty, the
broken homes, the increase in illness and suicides. And it will provide the
resources we need to increase social spending, as we must, at least in line with
the growth of the economy.
How will we pay for it?
Given our commitment to increase public spending, it is right that people should
ask: how will we pay for it?
It would be wrong to finance the initial boost to spending by increasing
taxation. Only if ours was a fully employed economy would this be the right way
of doing it. But our economy today is chronically under-employed. We have people
out of work, idle plant, and unused savings. To finance expansion by increasing
taxation in these circumstances would be wrong. For the increased spending in
one part of the economy would be cancelled out by decreased expenditure
elsewhere. Of course, once the economy gets much nearer to full employment, some
taxes will have to be increased, both to shift the tax balance towards those who
can best afford to pay, and to help finance our social programme.
Like any other expanding industrial enterprise, we shall borrow to finance our
programme of investment. This is better than borrowing, as the Tories are doing,
in order to pay for the dole queue or to provide finance for the Argentine
government to buy arms.
There is no shortage of savings in the country available for borrowing today.
Indeed, vast amounts of British money - more than the government's total
borrowing requirement last year - are flowing into overseas investment. For with
our present slump, there is not the demand for investment here.
But the scale of borrowing will not be nearly as great as the increase in
spending. Spending generates new income and new savings. As the economy recovers
we shall be able to spend less on keeping people unemployed. And when people get
jobs they will also pay income tax and spend more on goods which are taxed. Last
year benefit payments, and tax revenues foregone - because of unemployment -
cost the nation some &pound;17,000 million. There are also important savings to
be made by cancelling the present government 5 massive expenditure programmes on
Trident and on PWR nuclear reactors.
Working together
At the heart of our programme is Labour's new partnership with the trade unions.
Our policies have been worked out with them. The Tories take pride in rejecting
any chance of constructive co-operation with the trade unions. But it is the
nation that has paid the price - the economy in ruins, and industrial relations
a battlefield. We believe that there is a better way: to harness the goodwill
and co-operation of working people and to work together to create a better life
for all.
Our starting point in government will be to discuss and agree with the trade
unions a national economic assessment, as described in our joint statement with
the TUC, Partners in Rebuilding Britain. This will set out the likely growth in
the national output and how it could be shared. It will cover the allocation of
resources, and the distribution of income between profits, earnings from
employment, rents, social benefits and other incomes. It will also take into
account our policies on the redistribution of income and wealth, not least
through the reform of taxation. It will take a view on what changes in costs and
prices would be compatible with our economic and social objectives, and help to
ensure that our plan for expansion is not undermined by inflation. We will not,
however, return to the old policies of government-imposed wage restraint. The
assessment will thus play a crucial part in our national plan.
The assessment will also play an important role in Labour's plans for the
redistribution of wealth and power in our society. For, as we emphasise in
Labour's Programme, our aim is nothing less than to bring about 'a fundamental
and irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working
people and their families'.
An offensive against low pay
The next Labour government will launch an offensive against low pay as part of
our strategy for equality. The problem of low pay remains acute both in relative
and absolute terms. If low pay at present is defined as less than two-thirds of
average male manual earnings, there were 3 million full-time low-paid workers in
1982, of whom over 2 million were women workers. Adding to these figures young
workers, part-time workers and homeworkers produces a total in the region of
almost 6 million - a great majority of whom are women.
We will work together with the unions to tackle low pay and extend the concept
of fair wages and arbitration. We will strengthen the Equal Pay Act. We strongly
emphasise the principles of fairness and proper comparability, and will ensure
machinery is available for the trade unions to establish these principles. We
will also discuss with the TUC the possibility of introducing a minimum wage.
Industrial democracy
Industrial democracy is vital to the success of the national plan. We believe
that working people must have clear and definite rights to a say in running
their firms - and to an influence in economic planning. We will give new
statutory rights to workers - through their trade unions - on information,
consultation and representation within their companies. These are described in
our joint statement with the TUC, Economic Planning and Industrial Democracy.
But we will work out with the unions concerned what this means for the
individual industries and firms.
We will repeal the divisive Tory 'employment' laws and provide new statutory
support for collective bargaining. We will also give proper employment
protection to women and to homeworkers, part-time workers and temporary workers.

The Tories' cut-backs in the work of the Health and Safety Commission will be
reversed. Labour will actively support the commission and the role of joint
safety committees in the work place.
Safeguards for expansion
Increased spending will not be enough to ensure sustained economic growth.
Spending will not create jobs if it is soaked up by imports. We must not allow
firms to use a return to growth as an excuse to put up prices. It will, in
addition, be essential to co-ordinate expansion so proper investment is made for
the future.
First, we will see that our financial and monetary policies support expansion.
We will make sure that public borrowing is financed, through the financial
institutions and national savings, without disruptive or damaging changes in
interest rates.
Second, exchange controls - maintained by successive British governments since
1939; and so foolishly scrapped by the Tories in 1979 - will be re-introduced.
This will help to counter currency speculation and to make available - to
industry and government in Britain - the large capital resources that are now
flowing overseas.
Third, we must ensure that our trade and balance of payments contribute to our
expansion. This means maintaining the pound at a realistic and competitive rate.
Tory monetary policies have kept interest rates far too high, pushing the pound
beyond its competitive value. An overpriced pound taxes exports and subsidises
imports. Our balance of trade, other than North Sea oil, has been seriously
damaged as a result. A competitive exchange rate will assist British exports
abroad and make British goods more competitive at home.
A policy for imports
But we must also plan ahead so that, as the economy expands, we keep our exports
and imports in balance. We must therefore be ready to act on imports directly:
first, in order to safeguard key industries that have been seriously put at risk
by Tory policy; and second, so as to check the growth of imports should they
threaten to outstrip our exports and thus our plan for expansion. We will:
  Use agreed development plans, which we shall negotiate with the large
  companies that dominate our economy, so as to influence their purchasing and
  development policies. Our aim will be to prevent excessive import penetration
  and promote our own exports.
  Use public purchasing policy to help support our strategy.
  Introduce back-up import controls, using tariffs and quotas, if these prove
  necessary, to achieve our objective of trade balance - upon which sustained
  expansion depends.
Our purpose in trade policy is not to reduce trade but to make possible an
orderly expansion of imports, paid for by our growing export trade. We will thus
be able to replace the present policies of deflation, which restrict world
trade, by policies of expansion, which increase world trade. We will also
encourage international action for expansion and increased world trade.
Within the framework of an orderly expansion of trade, we will also seek to give
real preferences to imports from developing countries, particularly from the
poorest countries, except where this will create acute problems for particular
industries in this country.
Prices - controlling inflation
The Tories have used mass unemployment to control inflation. We completely
reject this approach. We believe it is madness to keep people out of work
deliberately. Our priority will be to expand the economy and create jobs. But we
are also determined to prevent soaring prices. Expansion will in itself help cut
the costs of production and therefore hold back prices. But we will use other
measures to help restrain inflation. We will:
  Use direct measures of price restraint, such as cutting VAT, and subsidies on
  basic products, to cut into inflation as and when necessary.
  Stop using public sector charges, such as gas prices - up by 116 per cent
  since 1979 - as a back-door way of raising taxes, as the Tories have done.
  Buy our food where it is cheaper, on world markets, following Britain's
  withdrawal from the EEC.
  Give powers to a new Price Commission to investigate companies, monitor price
  increases and order price freezes and reductions. These controls will be
  closely linked to our industrial planning, through agreed development plans
  with the leading, price-setting firms.
  Take full account of these measures in the national economic assessment, to be
  agreed each year with the trade unions. The assessment will also take account
  of the impact of cost increases on the future rate of inflation.
Value for money
The Tories say that 'competition' ensures that shoppers get a fair deal. The
customers know better. Stronger legal safeguards are essential to protect
customers - not least from shoddy goods. And shoppers must know their rights and
be able to enforce them. We will undertake an urgent and comprehensive review of
consumer law and reform it. We will also bring in new safeguards on advertising.
We will:
  Establish a major public service facility - a Product Research Unit - to test
  products and manufacturers' claims about them, and to publicise the results
  widely.
  Set up consumer advice centres in all main shopping centres, with mobile units
  for rural areas.
  Provide simple court procedures for small claims, stronger trade codes of
  practice placed on to a statutory basis, and adequate penalties for trading
  offences.
  See that all public enterprises give a high priority to dealing with consumer
  complaints and needs - and back them with stronger consumer councils.
  Introduce a code of advertising practice, on a statutory basis, to be
  administered by the office of Fair Trading; and provide powers to order
  advertisements to be substantiated, withdrawn, or corrected with equal
  prominence.
Rebuilding our industry
The Tories have been a disaster for British industry. Plants and companies have
closed, skilled workers have been laid off, markets at home and abroad have been
lost to our competitors. Industry has not invested enough, and it has failed to
develop and exploit the new technologies as successfully as other industrial
countries.
We must rebuild our industrial strength - and we can do so under a Labour
Government working together with unions and managers, to plan Britain's
industrial development. Our aim is not just to save companies and factories from
closing down. We intend to create new companies and new science-based industries
- using new public enterprise to lead the way, and supported by the development
of industrial democracy.
In our joint statement with the TUC, Economic Planning and Industrial Democracy,
and in Labour's Programme 1982, we show how it can be done. We will:
  Develop a new five-year national plan to coordinate expansion and public
  spending with plans for individual industries and regions. We will create a
  powerful new Department of Economic and Industrial Planning.
  Involve the trade unions and management in planning at every level with a new,
  tripartite National Planning Council.
  Link planning at all levels firmly to a radical extension of industrial
  democracy. New statutory rights will enable workers to draw up plans for their
  own enterprises and sectors of industry, which we will seek to incorporate
  into our strategy.
  Make our planning flexible, so that it is able to respond quickly to changing
  circumstances and take full account of changing needs and preferences. We are
  opposed to any kind of rigid planning from the centre. But we will seek to
  develop a firm sense of strategic direction.
  Negotiate agreed development plans with all leading companies - national and
  multinational, public and private - so that such companies play a constructive
  role in supporting the national plan and our plans for individual regions and
  sectors.
  Support these agreed development plans with new industrial powers, including
  discretionary price controls, financial support and access to credit; and take
  powers to invest in individual companies, to purchase them outright or to
  assume temporary control.
  Monitor closely the activities of multinational companies, through a Foreign
  Investment Unit. All UK-based multinationals will have to operate within
  clearly laid-down guidelines.
  Develop regional development plans, with plans also being drawn up at local
  level by local authorities. Regional development agencies will be established,
  extending our present commitment to a Northern Development Agency to other
  English regions in need of them. These agencies will have similar powers and
  resources to those in Scotland and Wales. We will also consider using new
  regional job subsidies.
  Strengthen the NEB, the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, and the
  Industrial Development Board in Northern Ireland. We will give them, and the
  new development agencies, adequate resources for investment and acquisition.
Public and co-operative enterprise
We will use public and co-operative enterprise to support our planning and as a
major source of technical innovation. We will:
  Encourage and help existing public enterprises to expand and diversify. They
  will be given far more freedom to raise funds on capital markets.
  Return to public ownership the public assets and rights hived off by the
  Tories, with compensation of no more than that received when the assets were
  denationalised. We will establish a significant public stake in electronics,
  pharmaceuticals, health equipment and building materials; and also in other
  important sectors, as required in the national interest.
  Give generous encouragement and help to worker co-operatives and local
  enterprise boards. We will establish a Co-operative Investment Bank. The
  development agencies and local authorities will be empowered to support and to
  help establish co operatives and local enterprise boards. We will give new
  rights to workers to convert their firms into co-operatives.
Labour will also support key industries in the public sector. We will:
  Prevent the further decline of both public and private sectors of the steel
  industry so that the industry can, through planned investment, meet the rising
  demand from economic expansion. We will retain the five major BSC plants and
  see that a larger share of the home market is met from UK production. A major
  public presence will also be established in the steel stock-holding industry.
  Develop our aerospace industries. We will ensure that proper levels of
  research, development and investment take place, and that the industries have
  the capacity and skills needed to compete as equals in the world market. The
  British Aerospace Corporation will be re-established as a major public
  enterprise.
  Support the shipbuilding industry, which is vital for a maritime nation such
  as Britain, with interests in merchant shipping, the Navy, offshore oil and
  gas resources and fishing. Labour will establish a maritime strategy embracing
  both shipbuilding and shipping interests. We will re establish the British
  Shipbuilding Corporation as a public sector company with a new financial basis
  and adequate resources for investment.
Telecommunications
A national cable system will make possible a wide range of new
telecommunications services, greater variety in the provision of television, and
a major stimulus to British technology and industry. But it must be under firm
public control. A publicly-owned British Telecommunications will thus be given
the sole responsibility to create a national, broadband network (including
Mercury, the new privately-owned telecommunications system for business), which
integrates telecommunications and broadcasting.
Science and technology
Science and technology are essential to Britain's economic and social
regeneration. The Tories have undermined research and development in the
science-based research industries of the future. Cuts in higher education
threaten our fundamental research. Industry devotes less to research and
development than any other of our major industrial competitors. Defence accounts
for over 80 per cent of government research funds in industry.
The fall in output, together with the lack of planning and retraining, has meant
that new technology has brought major job losses in some sectors. Only Labour
can plan new technology to meet our commitment to full employment. We will:
  Guarantee adequate funding for higher education, the research councils and
  government research establishments.
  Use the National Investment Bank to channel funds from the financial
  institutions into long-term investment in new technology.
  Work together with trade unions to plan an expansion of new technology, in
  particular using it to aid a product-based recovery of the economy. New
  technology agreements, for proper safeguards and retraining for the
  work-force, will be extended.
  Strengthen the links between research by higher education and industry to help
  greater industrial innovation.
  Increase technological literacy in schools and give boys and girls equal
  opportunities to study science and technology.
  Promote the supply of engineers and technicians, including women, to meet the
  needs of industry and the community.
  Ensure that research and development are directed towards society's needs,
  with a reduction in the present high proportion of defence research.
  Promote the development and use of new information and communication services
  to support a wider democracy.
Finance for industry
It is essential that industry has the finance it needs to support our plans for
increased investment. Our proposals are set out in full in our Conference
statement, The Financial Institutions. We will:
  Establish a National Investment Bank to put new resources from private
  institutions and from the government - including North Sea oil revenues - on a
  large scale into our industrial priorities. The bank will attract and channel
  savings, by agreement, in a way that guarantees these savings and improves the
  quality of investment in the UK.
  Exercise, through the Bank of England, much closer direct control over bank
  lending. Agreed development plans will be concluded with the banks and other
  financial institutions.
  Create a public bank operating through post offices, by merging the National
  Girobank, National Savings Bank and the Paymaster General's Office.
  Set up a Securities Commission to regulate the institutions and markets of the
  City, including Lloyds, within a clear statutory framework.
  Introduce a new Pension Schemes Act to strengthen members' rights in
  occupational pension schemes, clarify the role of trustees, and give members a
  right to equal representation, through their trade unions, on controlling
  bodies of the schemes.
  Set up a tripartite investment monitoring agency to advise trustees and
  encourage improvements in investment practices and strategies.
We expect the major clearing banks to co operate with us fully on these reforms,
in the national interest. However, should they fail to do so, we shall stand
ready to take one or more of them into public ownership. This will not in any
way affect the integrity of customers' deposits.
Employment and training
The long-term unemployed - the men and women who have suffered most from the
Tory onslaught - will benefit directly from economic expansion and our policies
on regional development. But special measures are also needed. By the end of our
first five years, our aim is that no-one will be out of work for more than a
year without receiving an offer of a job or training place.
We will act quickly to save jobs and stop the further destruction of industry.
We will expand the schemes for compensating firms that avoid redundancy and
provide temporary jobs for the long-term unemployed. We will widen the Job
Release Scheme and offer employment subsidies to firms, linked to agreements
with them to preserve and create jobs. We will also provide major increases in
youth and adult training, with special provision for women, ethnic minorities
and the disabled; and integrate a reformed Youth Training Scheme into our scheme
for a two-year student-traineeship.
Industry has been badly hit by the collapse of training under the Tories.
Expansion must not be held back by shortages of skilled labour; and people
without work must have the skills needed to take up the available jobs. We will:

  Introduce a new statutory framework, linking adult training with initial
  training. This will also place a statutory duty on employers to carry out
  training and establish joint workplace training committees. Adequate funds
  will be provided jointly by industry and government.
  Give the Manpower Services Commission the authority and resources it needs to
  do the job. The commission will develop its regional and local structures,
  advise companies on their plans for manpower, and get advance notice of
  redundancies.
  Ensure that the MSC develops a national job centre network and reverses the
  cutbacks in occupational guidance and help for disadvantaged job seekers. We
  will take urgent steps to abolish private employment agencies.
Working time in Britain, over the life time of individual workers, is among the
highest in industrial countries. We will work through collective bargaining to
reduce working time; and this will include more flexible working arrangements,
more time off for study, longer holidays, earlier voluntary retirement with
adequate pensions - with progress towards our aim of a common pension age of 60
- and a 35 hour week.
Equal rights at work
Labour's aim is to create equal rights at work for women and to overcome the
effects of past discrimination. We will:
  Expand Positive Action Programmes to eliminate discrimination, change
  employment practices and introduce special training schemes to equip women to
  enter non-traditional areas of work.
  Carry out these programmes throughout the public sector, ensure that
  public-sector contracts include a commitment to positive action, and press
  employers and unions to negotiate these programmes through joint equal
  opportunities committees at the workplace. These proposals will be backed, if
  necessary, by a statutory duty on employers.
  Strengthen the Sex Discrimination and Equal Pay Acts to make them more
  effective. We will shift the burden of proof from the complainant to the
  alleged discriminator, incorporate the concept of indirect discrimination and
  introduce the principle of equal pay for work of equal value.
  End the distinction between part-time and full-time workers in terms of
  rights, hourly pay-rates and conditions, and extend greater employment
  protection to homeworkers and women on maternity leave.
We also aim to create equality of opportunity and treatment for black workers,
and similar positive action programmes will be carried through on their behalf.
Energy
Energy is vital to our future as an industrial nation. We will plan its supply
and demand more carefully and save more of the energy we use. As outlined in
Labour's Programme 1982, we will:
  Ensure that everyone can afford adequate heat and light at home.
  Give priority to the coal industry and the use of coal as a fuel. We will seek
  to re-establish the tripartite machinery set up under Labour and prepare a new
  Plan for Coal. We will also replace old plant with coal-fired stations.
  Assist major towns and cities to set up combined heat and power schemes.
  Begin a massive conservation programme, led by insulation for council housing,
  and giving incentives to industry on agreed plans to save energy. The
  programme will be managed by a new Energy Conservation Agency.
  Greatly increase spending on the development of renewable sources.
  Stop Sizewell and scrap the Tory PWR programme. The need for a continuing
  nuclear programme based on the British AGR will be reassessed when we come to
  office.
  Re-establish the Energy Commission to advise on the preparation and annual
  review of a comprehensive energy plan.
  Transfer the whole of the National Nuclear Corporation to the public sector.
Energy costs now represent a major part of family budgets. We will aim to reduce
these costs, both by conservation and by introducing new fuel allowances.
We will bring Britoil back into public ownership and combine it with BNOC to
create a powerful national oil corporation with full powers to engage in all
aspects of oil-related activities. We will restore to the new corporation a
minimum 50 per cent stake in all fields discovered since 1975; and, in line with
our objective to bring North Sea oil into public ownership and control, the
public sector will have the dominant role in all future oil and gas exploration
and development in the North Sea. We reaffirm our commitment to achieving full
public control and ownership of British Petroleum, in order to make it an
effective agent of a nationally directed oil policy.
Food, fishing and agriculture
Britain needs a food and agriculture policy much more in line with our needs -
and this is one of the prime reasons for leaving the EEC. Instead of the
inflated prices of the EEC's Common Agricultural Policy, we will support our
agriculture through deficiency payments - coupled, where necessary, with limited
intervention buying and direct income support.
As we describe in Labour's Programme 1982, we will conduct an 'annual
assessment' of the industry, after consultation with all those concerned. This
will set the level of support given to the industry. Labour will also negotiate
long-term supply agreements with agricultural producing nations; establish
commodity agencies and support marketing co-operatives; and, where helpful,
extend marketing boards to other sectors.
Together with the trade unions we will work to close the gap between
agricultural and industrial earnings, and replace the Agricultural Wages Board
with a statutory joint industrial council. We will also act to improve farm
safety, provide statutory support for workers' safety representatives, and end
pay discrimination against women workers.
We will give a new deal to the fishing industry. We will draw up a National
Fisheries Plan so as to take full advantage of our withdrawal from the EEC. We
will also provide public investment for the industry and improved conditions of
employment - including safety conditions - and introduce a licensing system for
registered fishing vessels and fishermen.
We will end the de-rating of agricultural land. We will also defend the
agricultural environment by giving a new priority to the effect on the
environment of our agricultural policies. We will make all agricultural aid
subject to environmental criteria and extend development controls to
agriculture.
We shall take tougher measures to control the use of pesticides and herbicides.
We shall establish a body with statutory powers to supervise their use, and in
particular we shall ban the use of 245-T. We shall strengthen controls on the
use of additives in feedstuffs, and in food, and ensure better labelling. Our
aim is to make it easier for new entrants, such as young farmers, to come into
the industry and obtain a tenancy. We will do this with the help of a new Rural
Land Authority, which will administer rural land already publicly-owned and
begin to extend public ownership to tenanted land.
For the forestry industry, we intend to reconstitute the Forestry Commission, as
described in Labour's Programme 1982, so that it operates as an expanding public
enterprise. The commission would cease to act as a spokesman for the private
sector; and it will be expected to extend its activities to include the
processing side of the industry. We will also seek to increase tree plantings.
A better deal for women
Labour's objective is to achieve equality between women and men. Over half the
population are women; yet in our society, paid employment is seen as important
while domestic skills - involving caring for children - do not enjoy their
proper status. Women should have a genuine choice between staying at home to
look after the family or going to work. Men and women should be able to share
the rights and responsibilities of paid employment and domestic activities, so
that job segregation within and outside the home is broken down.
Tory attacks on women's rights and opportunities have more than doubled the
numbers of unemployed women and destroyed services which women in particular
depend upon. Labour will do more than reverse these policies. We will:
  Expand current positive action programmes as well as introduce wide-ranging
  new schemes in order to encourage women to train and apply for new job
  opportunities, particularly in the area of new technology.
  Provide equal pay for work of equal value by amending the Equal Pay Act; and
  take action, together with the trade unions, against low pay.
  Strengthen the Sex Discrimination Act to include direct and indirect
  discrimination on the grounds of family status, and shift the burden of proof
  from the complainant to the alleged discriminator.
  Strengthen and expand the role of the Equal Opportunities Commission.
  Restore and extend women's employment rights to include part-time and home
  workers.
  Reverse the Tory attack on employment, social services and maternity rights.
  Improve the level of financial support to families with children and disabled
  dependants. The household duties test will be abolished. Extra help will be
  given to one-parent families.
  Establish an integrated system of child care with priority for children in the
  most deprived areas. Our aim will be to introduce, as soon as possible, a
  statutory duty on local authorities to provide nursery education for all pre
  school children whose parents wish it.
  Take steps to end discrimination in education and training, as set out in
  Labour's Programme 1982.
  Provide the resources to make a major improvement in the personal social
  services for the care of elderly, sick and disabled people.
  Within the NHS, improve community services, extend preventive measures
  including screening, and develop child health services.
  Increase the maternity grant to at least &pound;100.
  Provide fair treatment for widows.
  Increase the death grant to at least &pound;200.
  Work to establish equal treatment in tax and social security.
  End VAT on sanitary protection.
  Appoint a cabinet minister to promote equality between the sexes.
  Review the whole question of divorce and maintenance.
  Establish a fairer system of family law, and introduce Family Courts.
  Give more support for victims of rape; and provide an urgent review of police
  and court procedures in cases of rape and violence against women.
  Improve ante-natal and maternity services, and respect the wishes of women in
  childbirth.
  Support the provision of family crisis centres and more refuges for battered
  women.
While continuing to defend and respect the absolute right of individual
conscience, we will improve NHS facilities for family planning and abortion,
including counselling and day-care; and we will remove barriers to the
implementation of the existing right of choice for women in the termination of a
pregnancy.
Fair shares
Our plan for expansion must be supported by measures to create a fairer Britain.
We shall reform taxation so that the rich pay their full share and the tax
burden on the lower paid is reduced. By progressively increasing the real value
of the personal allowance, we will help the lower paid and those on average
earnings. We intend also to bring down the starting point of the highest rates
of tax, and to remove the present ceiling on earnings-related National Insurance
contributions.
In Labour's Programme 1982, we explain how we will reduce tax avoidance. This
will include action on family trusts and investment income. We also intend to
limit the open-ended availability to higher-rate tax payers of various tax
reliefs. A determined attack will be mounted on illegal tax evasion.
We shall also reform indirect taxation. We will extend zero-rating under VAT,
with different rates for essentials and non-essentials.
Capital taxes will be used to reduce the huge inequalities in inherited wealth.
We shall reverse most of the Tories' concessions on capital transfer tax and
introduce a new annual tax on net personal wealth, along the lines set out in
Labour's Programme 1982. This will ensure that the richest 100,000 of the
population make a fair and proper contribution to tax revenue.
Helping families
Labour will give families a better deal. Our first priority will be to help
families with children in order to support them in the task of parenthood. The
Tories refuse to accept the wide variety in the type and size of families. Their
policies restrict choice for members of families - in particular they reduce the
freedom of men and women to choose whether to work or to stay at home and look
after their families. At the same time, Tory policy has trapped more and more
families in poverty through a combination of means-tested benefits and a tax
system which bites hardest on the lowest paid.
We aim to recast the tax and benefit system, so as to redistribute resources to
families with children. Our priority is child benefit. We will increase it by
&pound;2.00 a week, make it index-linked, and subsequently improve it in real
terms, as resources allow. In the longer term, we shall aim to raise child
benefit to the level of child support given to those on long-term benefits. We
shall also restore the rights to weekly payment of child benefit; increase the
maternity grant to &pound;100; and give extra help to one-parent families.
We shall continue to help family budgets throughout the parliament:
  By increasing personal tax allowances - thus taking the poorest families out
  of the tax net;
  By making further increases in child benefit;
  By extending and improving the Invalid Care Allowance for those who care for
  disabled people.
To help pay for these improvements we shall, over the lifetime of the
parliament, phase out the married man's additional tax allowance for those under
the age of retirement. Married couples with dependants will clearly benefit
considerably from these changes - whilst the overall change for those without
dependants, given the increases in personal allowance, will be small in any one
year. However, we recognise that the loss of the allowance could cause financial
difficulty for those couples where one of the spouses is not in work. We shall
therefore consider how best to give support to these married couples where there
are no dependants. Our aim is to end sex discrimination in taxation. We favour
the principle of separate taxation and are examining how best to implement this.

A new deal for pensioners
We believe that elderly people, both today's pensioners as well as those who
will benefit in future from Labour's pension scheme, should share as of right in
our future prosperity. We shall:
  Uprate the pension in November 1983 by the full amount necessary to protect
  its real value against the rise in inflation to that date.
  Increase pensions, as soon as practicable, by &pound;1.45 for a single person
  and &pound;2.25 for a married couple. This is the amount pensioners have lost
  through the Tories breaking the link between pensions and earnings.
  Link pensions and average earnings, when these are rising faster than prices,
  and extend this to all benefits.
  Make progress towards our aim of a common pension age of 60.
  Double the Christmas bonus to &pound;20.
  Phase out the TV licence for pensioners, during the lifetime of the Labour
  government.
  Give women the additional tax allowance for the elderly - the age allowance -
  at 60 instead of 65.
  Increase the Death Grant to &pound;200 and extend it to cover all deaths.
  Introduce a Pension Schemes Act that will more adequately protect occupational
  pensions from the effects of inflation than they are at present; protect the
  position of early leavers; and extend to members of schemes, rights to
  participation and to greater information.
  Introduce, in areas where more favourable concessionary travel on local
  transport does not exist, a nationwide, off-peak, half-fares scheme for
  pensioners.
  Reform the harsh supplementary benefit rules introduced by the Tories.
  Reduce energy costs, for pensioners, both through support for conservation and
  by introducing new fuel allowances.
Help for the unemployed
Working people are entitled to a decent income when they lose their job through
circumstances beyond their control. An improved earnings-related supplement will
once again be paid during the first months of unemployment. We shall end the
discrimination whereby the unemployed are not entitled to the long-term rate of
supplementary benefit after a year. We shall also consider how best to improve
unemployment benefit for the longer-term unemployed so that large-scale
supplementation is not required.
Help for people with disabilities
The last Labour government established, for the first time, the basis for
eliminating poverty among disabled people. We intend to build on this. We will:
  Introduce a &pound;10 a week blindness allowance, as a first step towards the
  introduction of a new cash benefit for disabled people, which will vary
  according to the degree of disability.
  Bring up the non-contributory invalidity pension to the level of the flat-rate
  contributory invalidity benefit, and restore the 5 per cent cut in invalidity
  benefit.
  Help the many disabled people who are capable of working part-time or for
  limited periods, but discouraged by present benefit regulations. We shall
  amend these to take account of their needs.
  Abolish the household duties test for housewives' non-contributory invalidity
  pension and extend invalid care allowance to all those women presently
  excluded.
  Continue to pay mobility allowance to existing recipients as they reach the
  age of 75.
  Ensure the full implementation of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons
  Act.
  For those who require long-term care - elderly, mentally handicapped, mentally
  ill and disabled people - develop services within both the health service and
  the local authority services, based on support for them and their families
  within the community.
  Make proper provision for the 20 per cent of children requiring various forms
  of special education. We will promote and provide the resources for the
  integration within mainstream schooling of those children whose needs are best
  met by ordinary schools.
Labour will also aim to overcome discrimination against the disabled at work. We
will reverse the Tory cuts, which have caused unnecessary suffering for people
with disabilities. We shall increase the number of disablement resettlement
officers; extend capital grants to adapt employer's premises; strengthen
existing schemes - especially rehabilitation - to help disabled people back to
work; and introduce new legislation, including quotas, to secure employment
opportunities and job protection for disabled people.
A fairer benefit system
The new supplementary benefit scheme introduced by the Tories is harsh and
unfair. We shall reform it. The families of those involved in industrial
disputes will be entitled to full benefits - less any strike pay actually paid.
We shall return to a sliding scale for assessing capital and the surrender value
of insurance policies will be excluded. The anomaly which prevents some widows
from claiming long-term supplementary benefit will be removed. We shall give
extra help to families with children.
We shall improve staffing levels and physical conditions in social security
offices so as to provide a more humane and responsive service for claimants.
Many people fail to claim benefit to which they are entitled. We shall aim to
increase take-up by improvements in publicity and the provision of advice.
All the social security changes made by the Tories, including the new sick pay
and housing benefit schemes, will be reviewed. If they do not treat working
people and their families fairly, we will replace them.
Forty years have elapsed since the Beveridge Report which led to the setting up
of the National Insurance scheme by the post war Labour government. We shall
conduct a thorough review of the scheme in the light of today's circumstances.
The right to health care
The creation of the National Health Service is one of the greatest achievements
of the Labour Party. It now faces a double threat from the Tories: a lack of
resources for decent health care; and the active encouragement of private
practice. Labour will act to defend the basic principles of the service. We will
ensure that it is free at the point of use and funded out of taxation, and that
priority depends on medical need not ability to pay.
To meet rising costs due to improved medical technology and the age composition
of the population, and to allow for a general expansion of our under-funded
health services, we shall increase health service expenditure by 3 per cent per
annum in real terms. We will also seek a fairer distribution of these resources
at both regional and district level. Since the election, prescription charges
have increased from 20p to &pound;1.40 per item. Labour will phase out health
charges. We shall also ensure that NHS staff receive a fair reward for their
work and dedication; and we will discuss with the TUC new arrangements for pay
determination and the resolution of disputes.
Our overriding aim will be to reduce inequalities in standards of health care
for all who need it. We will:
  Give greater emphasis to prevention, both within the health and personal
  social services. We will come forward with proposals to help prevent accidents
  and disease, including action on advertising.
  Give priority to improving our primary health care services, especially in the
  inner cities.
  Continue to improve the ante-natal and maternity services and develop our
  child health services; and we will respect the wishes of women in child birth.

  Introduce an independent complaints system in both hospital and family
  practitioner services.
  Recognise the importance of community health councils and ensure that they
  have the power and facilities to represent fully the consumer point of view.
  Abolish the special charges for overseas visitors, and end passport checks.
  Take a major public stake in the pharmaceutical industry - and ensure that the
  drugs available are safe, effective and economic.
The present expansion in private medicine is a serious threat to our priorities
in health care. We will not allow the development of a two-tier health service,
where the rich can jump the queue. We shall remove private practice from the NHS
and take into the NHS those parts of the profit-making private sector which can
be put to good use. We shall also stop public subsidies to the private sector
and prevent it expanding further. We will give proper recognition to those
consultants who make a full-time commitment to the NHS; and we will provide
incentives to those choosing to work in under-doctored areas and specialities.
While continuing to defend and respect the absolute right of individual
conscience, we will improve NHS facilities for family planning and abortion,
including counselling and day-care; and we will remove barriers to the
implementation of the existing right of choice for women in the termination of a
pregnancy.
Personal social services
Personal social services - such as childcare, home helps, meals on wheels and
residential and day care for the elderly and handicapped, are a vital part of
our welfare state. And it is those who are most vulnerable in our society who
depend most upon them.
The Tory cuts in the social services have hit women hardest. They have meant
lost jobs for many women and a loss of support for the elderly and disabled,
thus forcing women to stay at home as unpaid carers. A major improvement in
personal social services will be necessary, not only to raise the standard of
living of those who depend upon them, but also to give women an equal right to
work. Labour will reverse the Tory cuts, improve and expand services so that
they can complement the much better community health services we shall provide.
This will involve increasing spending by at least 4 per cent a year in real
terms. We will:
  Increase joint finance and extend it to cover other agencies.
  Require social services departments to plan and develop services for children
  jointly with education and health authorities.
  Strengthen the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act so that it provides a
  Charter of Rights for disabled people everywhere.
  Require local authorities to develop preventive services for children at risk.

  Give greater attention to the needs of ethnic minorities.
  Encourage the growth of local, independent advice and advocacy services.
Education for the future
If individuals are to achieve their full creative potential, and our society is
to advance, we must substantially improve educational provision and opportunity.
The Tories' cuts have shown that they have no commitment to a free and fair
education system. The fact is, however, that economic and social progress will
depend on our success in making use of the abilities of the whole of our
population.
For the under-fives, our goal is to achieve comprehensive provision, with
priorities for children in the most deprived areas. We will unify education and
care services for the under-fives, both nationally and locally. Our aim will be
to introduce a statutory duty on local authorities to provide nursery education,
as soon as possible, for all pre-school children whose parents wish it.
Schools in the community
Primary education is fundamental to all educational and social development, as
any parent knows. We will restore funds to local education authorities to reduce
class sizes; and improve learning materials and facilities in primary schools so
that our children receive the best possible start in their schooling.
Secondary education is a period during which all young people must prepare
themselves as the workers and citizens of the future. We shall encourage a
higher standard of achievement among all pupils in the variety of academic and
other activities which are essential parts of fully comprehensive education. We
will:
  Repeal the Education Act 1979 and prohibit all forms of academic selection,
  such as the eleven plus, as a condition of admission to secondary schools.
  Require local education authorities to maintain a broad, balanced and
  comprehensive curriculum, providing genuinely equal opportunities for boys and
  girls, and for the ethnic minorities to meet the needs of our multi-cultural
  society.
  Establish a common system of assessment for all 16 year olds which will
  encourage effort and accurately record achievement at school.
Throughout the whole of schooling, we will:
  Determine a supply of appropriately qualified teachers to reduce class sizes.
  No class size should be over 30. The quality and frequency of teacher
  in-service training must be improved so that teachers receive no less than one
  school term of training in every five years of service.
  Discuss with the local authorities ways of developing a reformed system for
  funding education. Whilst safeguarding local democracy in education, this must
  secure and maintain improved national standards of provision in essential
  areas.
  Abolish corporal punishment; and help local authorities and schools to develop
  other methods, already successfully practised in many schools, for dealing
  with bad behaviour.
  Positively encourage parental understanding and participation in the education
  of their children by increasing parental representation on school governing
  bodies and increasing the links between home and school.
  Re-establish the school meals and milk services, cut back by the Tories. This
  will help to offset the inequalities, for example in nutrition, highlighted by
  the Black Report.
Private schools are a major obstacle to a free and fair education system, able
to serve the needs of the whole community. We will abolish the Assisted Places
Scheme and local authority place buying; and we will phase out, as quickly as
possible, boarding allowances paid to government personnel for their children to
attend private schools, whilst ensuring secure accommodation for children
needing residential education.
We shall also withdraw charitable status from private schools and all their
other public subsidies and tax privileges. We will also charge VAT on the fees
paid to such schools; phase out fee charging; and integrate private schools
within the local authority sector where necessary. Special schools for
handicapped pupils will retain all current support and tax advantages.
Post 16 education
For 16 and 17 year olds, we will introduce a two years' student-traineeship
within a third or 'tertiary', stage of education, as described in the section on
young people. A 'tertiary awards council' will be established to develop and
validate a proper system of educational assessment for the whole of the age
group. Our aim is to replace the rigid 'A' level system with a broader programme
of study within the student-traineeship, thus preventing over specialisation and
promoting flexibility and breadth in learning.
Our policy for education after eighteen is expansion with change. We will
reverse the Tory cuts and restore the right for all qualified young people
seeking higher education to secure places. We will also substantially expand
opportunities for adults in both further and higher education.
We reject the Tory proposals for student loans; and we will ensure students are
given adequate financial support. We will also provide proper financial support
for those on non-advanced, part-time advanced, and Open University courses.
Adult education
We are determined to give priority to adults who have been denied educational
opportunity on leaving school. We will:
  Give statutory backing to paid educational leave for workers.
  Phase in a new, adult educational entitlement that will provide one year of
  education, backed by financial support for adults who have never received
  education after eighteen.
  Require educational institutions to be more flexible in their admissions
  procedures and methods of study.
  Establish a proper legal basis for adult education; and create a development
  council to promote adult and continuing education.
  Establish machinery to plan and co ordinate all post 18-education together and
  ensure that the bodies funding universities, and planning local authority
  further, higher and continuing education, are more accountable and
  representative.
A new deal for young people
Labour will end the scourge of youth unemployment and prepare young people to
take up the jobs that we will create. We will also encourage all young people in
employment to join a trade union. Our radical new scheme for young people will
establish a new, two year student-traineeship for all 16 and 17 year olds. It
will bring together, for the first time, the first years of apprenticeships,
other training schemes for young workers and the young unemployed and courses in
full-time education in schools and colleges. We will:
  Give to young people who are at work the right to be released to college or
  school, on full pay. Employers will be given a statutory duty to provide
  opportunities for their young employees to receive systematic education and
  training and to release student-trainees at their request. Premiums will be
  paid to them to recruit young people and provide them with such opportunities.

  Abolish the so-called Young Workers' Scheme, set up by the Tories to reduce
  youth wages. Labour rejects completely the Tory argument that young people
  have priced themselves out of jobs.
  Offer all young people without work a place on new youth training schemes,
  with proper education and training opportunities - which can best be
  guaranteed by active monitoring by the trade unions; and give them an
  allowance of at least &pound;30 per week - the level of which will be agreed
  annually with the TUC - with trade unions being free to negotiate better
  terms.
  Provide student-trainees, in full-time education, with an educational
  maintenance allowance of &pound;25 a week, at 1983 prices, covering 52 weeks
  in a year.
Labour will establish new rights and provide more resources for youth. We will:
  Expand and improve the youth service so that it meets the social, cultural and
  recreational needs of young people - especially the unemployed, young women,
  the ethnic minorities and the young disabled.
  Established a 'youth initiatives fund' to give greater recognition and support
  to organisations which represent young people's interest.
  Encourage local authorities to support representative local youth councils as
  one of the means of enabling young people to influence public affairs as young
  adults.
  Expand funding and staffing for the provision of social studies and education
  for citizenship in youth clubs and schools with the aim of informing young
  people of their civil, political and trade union rights and responsibilities
  as citizens. Accredited trade union representatives should be involved with
  secondary school students in the context of such education, with full
  facilities for such representatives at all career days.
Homes for everyone
Britain faces a major housing crisis. The Tories have slashed public spending on
housing by half and house building is at its lowest since the 1920's. Houses are
falling into disrepair faster than they can be repaired, while homelessness and
waiting lists continue to grow. Labour will reverse this decline. Our aim is a
decent home for all with real freedom of choice between renting and owning, on
terms people can afford.
Labour governments have done more than any others to assist owner occupiers; and
we will extend this by giving special assistance to first-time buyers and
council tenants.
Labour will immediately increase by half the total housing investment programmes
for local authorities. This will be a first step in increasing resources for
council housing repairs and improvements and for new public sector house
building. We will also give a new priority to getting empty council owned
housing back into use. We will overhaul and extend the renovation grant and area
improvement programme to tackle properly the decay of our older houses. New and
better housing and environmental standards will be developed and greater
provision will be made for hitherto neglected groups, such as single people.
Council housing
The Tories have forced council rents to more than double. The number of council
homes for rent is falling because of the rundown of new building and enforced
sales. Thousands have to cope with leaking roofs and damp, inadequate heating,
broken down lifts, noise, lack of security, increasing disrepair and neglect.
Labour will give council tenants a new deal. In addition to a freeze on rents
for a full year, and the restoration of subsidies, Labour will:
  fund a national action programme to repair and improve or replace run-down
  estates, especially the system-built developments in which so many defects
  have been revealed.
  Strengthen tenants' rights on security, repairs and improvements, access to
  files, exchanges, transfers, moves between local authority areas, and
  rehousing rights on breakdown of relationship;
  Encourage more responsive and decentralised housing management and
  maintenance, and promote tenant participation and democracy, including housing
  co-operatives;
  End all residential and other qualifications, which unfairly exclude people
  from council housing in the area where they live, extend the 'priority' groups
  under the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act and strengthen the rights of homeless
  people;
  End enforced council house sales, empower public landlords to repurchase homes
  sold under the Tories on first resale and provide that future voluntary agreed
  sales will be at market value.
Home ownership
Labour believes in real home ownership at prices people can afford. Under the
Tories the mortgage rate reached its highest ever level at 15 per cent and is
still at 10 per cent. They have done little to help low income groups become
owners.
We support financial assistance for owner-occupation and will maintain mortgage
tax relief for existing house purchasers at the current rate. The unfairness of
mortgage tax relief above the basic rate, which gives most benefit to the
highest incomes, will be phased out. We will also examine the possibility of a
new and substantial form of financial help for first time buyers, with special
consideration for council and new town tenants, aimed at easing the heavy
initial burdens of house purchase.
Labour will act to help home-owners. We will:
  Simplify and reduce the cost of house purchase, ending the solicitors'
  conveyancing monopoly, and require full disclosure of mortgage lending terms
  and practices;
  Make it easier for lower income groups to borrow funds on secure terms by
  greatly expanding council mortgage lending and providing the funds needed.
  This will be financed primarily by on-lending from the building societies, at
  least 10 per cent of whose funds should be made available in this way;
  Allow and encourage councils to provide a unified house-purchase service,
  including estate agency, surveying, conveyancing and mortgage lending;
  End the leasehold system for houses, strengthen the rights of leaseholders of
  flats and increase protection to mobile home residents.
Privately rented housing
The worst housing conditions are in privately rented housing. The Tories have
loosened the controls on rents and security of tenure and pushed up rents. If
they get the chance, they would abolish all controls.
Labour will ensure that tenants are fully protected. We will:
  Actively encourage the transfer of all property owned by absentee private
  landlords to the public or owner-occupied sectors, with local authorities
  setting the pace. This will not apply to owner-occupiers letting all or part
  of their home.
  Repeal the Tories' shorthold scheme and close other loopholes in security of
  tenure; and strengthen tenants' rights on deposits and harassment.
  Strengthen councils' powers to enforce repairs and improvements and the
  standards of management, particularly in multi-occupied properties; and launch
  a programme of action against property held empty without justification.
  Bring forward measures to strengthen tied tenants' rights and improve their
  access to secure housing when they leave their job.
  Bring service charges for private tenants and leaseholders within the fair
  rents scheme.
Help for all tenants
Tenants in both the public and private sectors are plagued with difficulties
caused by all-too frequent failure of landlords to carry out repairs
satisfactorily and speedily. Tenants recognise that major structural repairs,
for example to blocks of flats or maisonettes, can only be dealt with by
large-scale improvement projects. But they rightly see no reason why routine
repairs should be neglected. Labour will launch a new initiative aimed at
tackling this troublesome problem.
We will introduce a right to repair for all tenants - council, new town, housing
associations and private landlord. This will give tenants the right to force
landlords, including councils, to get routine repairs done, with landlords
footing the cost. Where there are council direct labour organisations, these
will be responsible for doing this work. Major structural work will not be
included, but the Labour government will assist councils to carry out such work
through much larger capital investment allocations and reinstatement of an
adequate housing subsidy system.
We also intend to reform the system of housing benefits for low income groups. A
new Housing Tribunal will be established to replace the present confusing jumble
of courts, tribunals and committees, as an accessible means of resolving
landlord-tenant disputes.
Construction
The Tory recession has seriously damaged the construction industry. Company
after company has gone bankrupt. Nearly 400,000 construction workers are on the
dole. Labour's plan for expansion will help the industry back to its feet. But
we will also introduce changes to the industry, as described in Labour's
Programme, 1982 - not least to help stabilise the industry's workload. We will
also provide greater job security for employees; and we will work out, with the
agreement of the trade unions, a system of decasualisation.
We also believe that a major new role should be played in the industry by public
and co-operative enterprise - to provide a new source of enterprise, initiative
and innovation. We will establish a new, publicly-owned company, as a major
pace-making public enterprise, for large and medium-sized construction projects.
In addition, to help protect the public interest, we will extend public
ownership into the building materials industry, in which a small number of large
companies now enjoy near monopoly conditions.
We will also give generous and active support to the development of workers' co
operatives, especially at the jobbing' end of the industry. We will reverse Tory
policies towards local authority direct labour organisations. We will give them
more scope by allowing them to compete for other work in their locality, while
ensuring that they are efficiently run as municipal enterprises. We will oppose
the contracting out of government services to privately-owned companies.
Planning for people
The way we plan the use of our land affects every one of us. It determines where
we build our housing, the kind of shopping centres which are available, and
where new jobs and factories are sited. We are determined to strengthen local
planning and ensure greater participation by ordinary people over the decisions
which affect their lives.
The Tories have always put the interests of property developers before the needs
of local people. Labour will change this. We will ensure that local authorities
are able to decide on the positive use of land in their areas instead of having
to respond to the initiatives of developers. And we shall take explicit powers
to link land-use planning firmly with the economic and social planning of local
authorities.
A key issue in planning at local level is the ownership and use of land. We are
determined to stop land speculation and make sensible and comprehensive planning
possible. We will establish new land authorities, similar to the successful Land
Authority of Wales, with the powers and funds needed to acquire development land
- at its current use value - so that local plans can be fulfilled. Our proposals
do not apply to owner-occupiers, whose homes and gardens will be safeguarded.
We intend also to widen democratic participation in the planning system by:
  Codifying and extending public rights of consultation, and of appeal against
  planning decisions;
  Improving access to public planning inquiries and broadening their terms of
  reference;
  Ensuring that, before the inquiry stage of certain major development
  proposals, the environmental effects are subject to detailed analysis and the
  report is published;
  Creating a new fund to help objectors at major public inquiries, with an
  independent board to decide who should be helped and by how much.
The inner cities
The decay, squalor and level of unemployment in our inner cities are a national
disgrace. Labour is determined to reverse their decline. We will provide more
resources, more investment and more jobs. We will act to ensure, through the
policies set out in this campaign document, that people living in the inner
cities have access to decent homes, health and education - and that there is
proper accountability for the police.
In addition to providing a major increase of funds for the Urban Programme, we
will:
  Use agreed development plans, negotiated at national level with major firms -
  public and private - to locate investment and jobs in the inner cities.
  Use regional development agencies to prepare sites, encourage municipal and
  co-operative enterprise, and help improve transport and other facilities.
  Get local authorities to prepare local economic and social plans. We will also
  support the development of well-financed local enterprise boards in areas
  which need them - and enable local authorities to conclude agreed development
  plans with small and medium-sized local firms.
The environment
Labour believes that the countryside should be preserved and enhanced as a
source of recreation for town and country dwellers alike and as a habitat for
wild creatures and plants. Everyone has a right to a decent living and working
environment.
We intend to monitor closely - and publicly - the nation's progress in improving
the environment. We shall therefore present to parliament each year a major
report on the 'State of the Environment'. We will also safeguard our heritage
by:
  Supporting rights of access to common land. We will stop landed interests from
  preventing access for anglers;
  Strengthening the planning laws to ensure that the countryside is protected
  from damaging development;
  Strengthening the legislation which protects endangered species;
  Providing increased resources so that the Nature Conservancy Council and
  Countryside Commission can function effectively;
  Enacting a new Wildlife and Countryside Act and providing proper protection
  for sites of special scientific interests.
  We will also act to curb pollution. We will:
  Proceed with the implementation of the 1974 Control of Pollution Act.
  Undertake a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of the present machinery
  and powers on pollution control.
  Eliminate lead in petrol by setting a date after which all new cars will be
  required to use only lead-free petrol. The interests of motorists will be
  safeguarded.
  Restore those environmental agencies abolished by the Tories with a
  responsibility for monitoring air and noise pollution.
  Develop a programme for eliminating toxic substances from our living and
  working environments.
We will reform the water industry by repealing the Tories' Water Act and
restoring democratic accountability in the industry. We will re-establish a
national authority charged with responsibility for the strategic planning and
use of all water resources. The canal system will be brought under a new
national authority, so that it can be developed and maintained as an essential
water resource. We will also consider how best to provide help, for those on low
incomes, with paying their water rates.
Rural areas
Tory policies have seriously harmed the rural areas. Bus services have
disappeared. Rail links are under threat. Jobs have been axed. Houses are not
being built. Village halls and sub-post offices have been closed. Labour will
act to improve the quality of life in the rural areas; and we have outlined our
plans in Labour's Programme 1982 and in our statement Out of Town, Out of Mind.
We will give greater priority to rural problems. And ministers will be expected
to bring about greater co-ordination in promoting our policies. We will:
  Ensure that the Development Commission, and its counterparts in Scotland and
  Wales, become actively involved in implementing our policies for rural
  regeneration.
  Take measures to increase employment by encouraging the expansion of light
  industry and tourism in the rural areas, while safeguarding the rural nature
  of the countryside.
  Improve the rural public transport network by a major injection of public
  funds and a better use of existing resources.
  Wherever possible retain village schools and generally improve educational
  provision for all age groups; and introduce mobile health clinics and mobile
  'all purpose' community services offices.
  Take extensive measures to expand the provision of all types of housing in the
  rural areas, which will also help to deal with the 'Second Home' problem.
Transport
Four years of Tory government has meant serious damage to Britain's transport
system. Profitable elements have been sold off. Important but unprofitable
sections left in public hands are being starved of investment. The quality of
public transport services has fallen disastrously.
Another Tory government would mean even poorer services, higher fares and lower
safety standards. Labour repudiates this whole approach. We believe that the
improvement of public transport must be a major social priority, which can only
be achieved by a sensibly integrated transport system. We describe our proposals
in Labour's Programme 1982.
We will maintain and improve the rail network, invest in the electrification of
the main lines and replace worn-out railway stock. We will encourage the use of
the railways for freight traffic by extending grants for rail freight facilities
and encouraging the development of trans-shipment depots.
Heavy lorries will be made to bear their full share of road costs, including
environment costs. We will cut to a minimum noise and pollution from goods
vehicles and introduce national routeings and restrictions to take lorries away
from people. Vehicle Excise Duty for private cars will be abolished and the
revenue secured by a higher tax on petrol.
Labour believes that, together with a properly enforced licensing system, a
publicly-owned share of the road haulage industry is essential. It would clearly
be sensible for the National Freight Company to form part of this sector; and we
are examining how best to bring this about.
We will ensure that local authorities are able to give proper support to public
transport. In areas where more favourable concessionary travel on local
transport does not exist, we shall bring in a nationwide, off-peak half-fares
scheme for pensioners. A proper licensing system, to safeguard the network of
bus services, will be reintroduced. We shall also ensure that a basic minimum
level of service is provided throughout the country.
In addition, we will:
  Encourage the development of effective traffic management schemes to alleviate
  the problems of traffic congestion.
  Improve facilities and safety standards for cyclists and increase financial
  incentives to local authorities to assist these improvements.
  Give a high priority to building by passes.
  Establish a national shipping organisation able to acquire and operate
  shipping services; and protect our shipping and jobs from unfair foreign
  competition.
  Invest in inland waterways, and encourage the greater use of them - and of
  coastal shipping - in the interests of taking freight off our roads.
  Establish a new National Ports Authority to take ports into public ownership
  and to develop a new overall strategy for these.
  Create a National Transport Authority to develop transport policy and good
  practice, secure integration and facilitate comprehensive planning.
Law, order and justice
Labour's aim is to ensure that all sections of the community are safe on the
street and at home, free from the fear that crime generates. We believe that the
police should have the support of the community, have their rights safeguarded,
and be fairly paid. But we also believe that it is as much in the interests of
the police, as of their local communities, that they are properly accountable
and fully subject to the law. We will ensure that, throughout the country, the
police are encouraged to return to the beat and therefore closer to the
communities they serve. That is the best way of preventing and detecting crime.
We intend to protect the rights of individual suspects, while providing the
police with sufficient powers to do their job effectively whilst not infringing
the civil rights of individual suspects. We aim to create elected police
authorities in all parts of the country, including London, with statutory
responsibility for the determination of police policy within their areas. We
will also:
  Launch a major initiative to help victims, including extending and simplifying
  the present Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.
  Give priority to crime prevention as part of our action programme for run down
  estates.
  Bring about better co-ordination in the technical, support and information
  services of the police.
  Replace the present police complaints procedure with an independent system
  accountable to local communities, with minority police representation.
  Create community police councils to provide an opportunity for open discussion
  between police and the community as to the quality and manner of police
  provision.
  Introduce strict limits on searches of people in the street, searches of
  premises, the use of the power of arrest, and on the time a prisoner can be
  held in custody before being charged.
  Protect the rights of those in police custody, by giving revised Judges Rules,
  which safeguard those under arrest or interrogation, the force of law and, in
  England and Wales, take the role of prosecutor away from the police by
  implementing a public prosecutor system, on the Procurator Fiscal model.
  Repeal the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill, because it infringes the rights
  and freedoms of individuals.
  Disband the London Special Patrol Groups and local SPGs, which have
  increasingly been deployed in aggressive public order roles.
Access to legal services
We will not allow people's legal rights to go by default. Accessible level
services are essential to protect human rights. As described in Labour's
Programme 1982, we will increase central government spending to set up new law
centres and help existing ones, and to improve the legal aid scheme by widening
its provisions. We will also introduce a system of appeals against the refusal
of legal aid in criminal cases.
We will speed the extension of duty solicitor schemes to all magistrate courts
and police stations in England and Wales. We will also introduce measures to
help citizens to secure their legal rights in the areas of tribunal and welfare
rights law.
We will co-ordinate the responsibility for advice and legal services so that
ministerial responsibility is clearer and more direct. We will also establish a
new Legal Services Commission to be responsible for the provision and financing
of public legal services. Our aim is to ensure that the expertise and training
of the legal profession should be geared far more than at present to those legal
problems affecting ordinary people.
The penal system
No one concerned for human dignity and civil rights can find our prison system
acceptable. We are determined to improve conditions. We do not accept that wives
and children should be punished together with the prisoners. We will:
  Reduce the prison population by cutting many maximum sentence lengths for
  non-violent offenders. We will stop putting petty offenders into prison. We
  will expand non-custodial alternatives, and examine new penalties involving
  reparation and restitution to the victim. We will also introduce a maximum
  period of custody for those on remand, along the lines of the provisions in
  Scotland.
  Treat prisoners as human beings by providing reasonable conditions in our
  prisons. We will incorporate, in new, legally enforceable prison rules,
  minimum standards on such matters as cell space. And we will reduce
  unnecessary restrictions - for example on prisoners' correspondence.
  Refurbish urban prisons.
  Hand over all specialist services in prisons, such as medical care, to the
  normal community agencies.
  Establish a genuinely independent complaints and disciplinary procedure to
  replace the current board of visitors system; and provide better aftercare for
  those leaving prison, to help them resettle in the community.
  Improve the training, working conditions and job opportunities of prison
  officers.
  Examine the additional problems faced by women prisoners, especially those
  with young children.
Equal rights
The next Labour government will lead a political offensive against racial
disadvantage, discrimination and harassment; and we have set out our proposals
in Labour's Programme 1982. To encourage equality and reduce discrimination, we
will greatly expand funding to ethnic minority projects. We will also encourage
local authorities, in selecting projects under the Urban Programme, to provide
for greater ethnic minority participation. We will also:
  Stimulate a wide range of positive action programmes to ensure that ethnic
  minorities receive a fair deal - in employment, education, housing and social
  services: and encourage the keeping of ethnic records, in order to assess the
  needs of ethnic minorities and take steps to meet them.
  Launch a major public education initiative aimed at eliminating prejudice.
  Strengthen the existing Race Relations Act - in particular, to enable us to
  deal more effectively with racialist literature, speeches and marches; and to
  remove the exception for seamen recruited abroad.
  Appoint a senior minister to lead the offensive against racial inequality.
We are concerned that homosexuals are unfairly treated. We will take steps to
ensure that they are not unfairly discriminated against - especially in
employment and in the definition of privacy contained in the 1967 Act - along
the lines set out in Labour's Programme, 1982.
Nationality and immigration
Through their immigration and nationality laws, the Tories have divided families
and caused immense suffering in the immigrant communities. We accept the need
for immigration controls. But we will repeal the 1971 Immigration Act and the
1981 British Nationality Act and replace them with a citizenship law that does
not discriminate against either women or black and Asian Britons.
Under our Nationality Act, we will restore rights removed by the Tories, such as
the right to automatic citizenship if born in Britain. The Act will enable other
Commonwealth and foreign nationals to acquire citizenship if they qualify by
objective tests, and provide a right of appeal against the refusal of an
application for citizenship. We will also ensure that the cost of acquiring
citizenship will no longer be an obstacle to those who wish to apply.
Under our new Immigration Act we will liberalise the age limit criteria for
children and the criteria for elderly parents and other relatives. We will
simplify the procedures and commit the resources necessary for all applications
to be processed promptly; and allow medical examinations, including x-rays, only
for medical, not administrative purposes. The race and sex discrimination in the
husbands and fiances' rules will be ended: we will restore the entitlement to
admission to join a woman settled here irrespective of her citizenship,
birthplace or ancestry. We will also ensure that immigration officials fully
respect the human rights of those seeking entry. We will also:
  Consult Commonwealth governments so as to resolve the question of the other
  British nationals from independent countries who possess no other citizenship.

  Provide a right of appeal for those who the Home Secretary proposes to deport
  or exclude on security grounds.
  Establish a more independent and balanced panel of adjudicators for
  immigration appeals.
A wider democracy
Labour will take action to enhance democratic rights and ensure greater openness
and accountability in the institutions of government. We have set out our
policies in Labour's Programme, 1982. We shall:
  Introduce a Freedom of Information Bill, providing for a genuine system of
  open government and placing the onus on the authorities to justify withholding
  information.
  Bring in data protection legislation to prevent the abuse of confidential
  information held on personal files; and, subject to certain exceptions, allow
  individuals access to their personal records.
  Reform the administration of government and the civil service machine so that
  it meets modern needs and is properly accountable to elected representatives.
  We recognise the damage done to the morale and efficiency of the civil service
  by this government. We will work to repair this damage, together with the
  unions, and to give proper recognition to the importance of the work of the
  service.
  Take action to abolish the undemocratic House of Lords as quickly as possible
  and, as an interim measure, introduce a Bill in the first session of
  parliament to remove its legislative powers - with the exception of those
  which relate to the life of a parliament.
  Make improvements in the legislative process and procedures in the House of
  Commons.
  Reform the procedures for appointments to public bodies to ensure they are
  more open and genuinely representative of the community.
  Overhaul the outdated honours system.
  Give a new priority to making our public services more responsive to the needs
  and wishes of those who use them. Wherever possible we will decentralise
  services to make them as close as possible to those who use them. We will also
  provide more effective procedures for complaints - with clear rights for users
  - and ensure better training and status for those in contact with the public.
Labour believes that state aid for political parties is now essential for the
working of our parliamentary democracy. We will introduce such aid, along the
lines set out in the Houghton Report, with the funds available adjusted to
today's prices and index linked.
The security services
There is now widespread concern about our security services. We intend that they
should become properly accountable institutions - and that the civil rights of
individuals are fully protected. We outline in Labour's Programme, 1982 our
proposals for a new Security Act, to define the powers and responsibilities of
the services, including those concerned with the interception of communications.
We will also extend parliamentary accountability - including over the accounts
of the services - which will be assisted by a new select committee; prohibit,
under the Security Act, unauthorised surveillance; and abolish 'D' notices.
Local democracy
Labour is determined to strengthen local democracy. We will shift radically the
balance between central and local government and give local communities much
more say about how their services are run.
First, we will give local authorities freedom to implement comprehensive local
plans, covering economic, social and environmental policies. We explain
elsewhere in this document, and more fully in Labour's Programme, 1982, our
proposals to assist local authorities to create jobs, to establish local
enterprise boards and engage in local economic planning. We will reverse Tory
policies on the privatisation of local authority services.
Second, we will expand the scope for local democracy. Instead of local
councillors never being completely sure what is permitted and what is ultra
vires, we shall give a power of general competence to all local authorities to
carry out whatever activities are not expressly forbidden by statute. We shall
also seek to define the relationship between central and local government - as
part of our consideration of the universal application of realistic minimum
standards - so that basic provision of key services is available in all parts of
the country. We will also:
Take action to encourage councils to make their services more responsive to the
needs and wishes of their clients and of the local community.
Extend workers' rights and industrial democracy in local government, by enabling
non-voting employee representatives to be co-opted on to committees, and
encouraging the introduction of formal procedures for participation in decisions
on the implementation of policy. We will also allow all but the most senior
officers the right to become elected or co-opted members of the authority which
employs them.
Pay proper allowances, and provide adequate administrative support, to local
councillors.
We are examining how best to reform local government. We believe that services
such as health, water and sewerage should become answerable to a much greater
extent to elected members; and we aim to end, if we can, the present confusing
division of services between two tiers of authority. Unitary district
authorities, in England and Wales, could be responsible for all of the functions
in this area that they could sensibly undertake. We will also ensure that the
City of London is absorbed into a reformed democratic system of local
government. For Scotland, any reform of local government will be a matter for
our proposed Scottish Assembly.
Local government finance
Labour will reverse the Tory government's attacks on local authority services.
We shall provide finance, through the rate support grant, to allow local
authority expenditure to grow in line with our plans for economic expansion; and
the hard-pressed urban areas will benefit especially from an increased share of
the resources available.
Labour believes in active local democracy. We will therefore repeal the Tory
legislation which allows the government to impose ceilings on local authority
spending, and to impose penalties on local authorities whose spending exceeds
those ceilings. We shall repeal the ban on supplementary rates. We will restore
the right of local authorities to spend additional amounts from revenue on
capital expenditure in excess of loan sanction limits. The rate support grant
system will be recast to give fairer treatment to areas in greatest need and the
maximum freedom of action for local authorities to control their own budgets.
Labour will also enact legislation to abolish the penalty of personal surcharge
on individual councillors. Instead councillors, like others in the community,
will be liable at law for any unlawful or illegal acts. Public audit will be
confined to that purpose and auditors will not be permitted to involve
themselves in judgements on politics or policies.
Devolution to Scotland
Labour is determined to decentralise power in decision-making. In Scotland, the
people have shown their support for devolution in a referendum and at successive
general elections; and we have set out our proposals for devolution in a major
statement, Scotland and Devolution. Labour will:
  Establish a directly elected Scottish Assembly, with an executive drawn from
  members of the assembly.
  Provide the Assembly with legislative and executive powers over a wide range
  of domestic policy, including matters such as health, education and social
  welfare.
  Ensure a major role for the Assembly in assisting in the regeneration of
  Scottish industry - including the preparation and implementation of a Plan for
  Scotland - within the context of our overall national plan.
  As well as receiving grants from central government, the Scottish Assembly
  will have tax-raising powers, thus ensuring that the level of services
  provided can be determined in Scotland.
Northern Ireland
Labour believes that Ireland should, by peaceful means and on the basis of
consent, be united, and recognises that this will be achieved with the
introduction of socialist policies. We respect and support, however, the right
of the Northern Ireland people to remain within the UK, although this does not
mean that Unionist leaders can have a veto on political development; and we
accept that, to achieve agreement and consent between the two parts of Ireland,
we must create greater unity within the Northern Ireland community.
In our 1981 conference statement and in Labour's Programme 1982, we set out in
full Labour's policy on Northern Ireland. We will aim to establish an agreed,
devolved administration. In the meantime, we will continue with direct rule. We
will also initiate early discussions between the British government, the Irish
government, the Irish Labour Party, and the trade unions on both sides of the
border, and political representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, on how
best to proceed with our policy of unification by consent.
Tory policies have been a disaster for the Northern Ireland economy.
Unemployment has soared. The economy is in ruins. Housing and the social
services are in desperate straits. Labour will give new hope to Northern
Ireland. We will create jobs and provide investment. We will use all of the
economic planning powers and institutions set out in this document - together
with a massive injection of public resources - to rebuild the economy.
We will also act on security and civil rights, along the lines set out in our
1981 statement. We will repeal the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Payment
of Debt Act and reform the system of Diplock courts. We will provide equal
rights for women, including rights to abortion, and make progress towards an
integrated comprehensive system of education.
Leisure for living
Labour believes that a comprehensive approach is needed, at national and local
levels, to provide services and facilities for leisure.
The arts
A crucial part will be played in this by the arts. Labour's aim is to make the
arts, in their broadest sense, an accepted part of everyday life for the whole
population. We will place special emphasis on their availability to the young,
the handicapped and the retired. Substantial extra funds will be provided, with
priority being given to the regions and to access for those on low incomes.
Local authorities will have a statutory duty to provide adequate arts and
entertainments facilities; and the arts will be zero-rated in respect of VAT.
We will retain a Minister of the Arts, whose first task will be to undertake a
major survey on the disparities in provision between regions and to produce
proposals for action. The public bodies which support the arts will also be made
more open and accountable, and include more representation from workers in the
arts, local authorities and consumers. The Craft Council will be strengthened,
and regional museums and galleries supported through a Museums and Galleries
Council.
For the film industry, we will establish a British Film Authority, responsible
for the National Film Finance Corporation. This will ensure that revenue from a
levy on ticket sales goes to British film-makers who produce British films. We
will also ensure that the profits from British film-making and distribution are
channelled back into British films - and that the present two-company monopoly
of film distribution in Britain is ended. The new British Film Authority will be
responsible for extending public ownership into film distribution.
Sport and recreation
Labour will accept responsibility for the provision of a broadly-based leisure
service. We will:
  Encourage greater participation in sport and recreation.
  Give incentives to voluntary bodies to involve themselves more widely in the
  provision of sporting and community facilities.
  Encourage local authorities and other owners of facilities to make them much
  more available to public use.
  Set up an immediate enquiry into the financial basis of sport and recreation.
    Review the provision of national sporting facilities, so as to secure a
    fairer geographical distribution.
    Ensure that the sporting talent of the nation receives sufficient support to
    enable them to bring sporting success to Britain.
We will also provide for the wider use of the countryside for recreational
purposes, such as angling and other water-based sports. Angling will be given
additional support, by ensuring wider access to rivers and lakes, financial
assistance to provide a wider ownership of fishing waters, improvements in
respect of conservation, and action to prevent pollution.
The media
Our aims in the media are to safeguard freedom of expression, encourage
diversity and establish greater accountability. For all the media, we will
introduce a statutory right of reply to ensure that individuals can set the
record straight. We will introduce stronger measures to prevent any further
concentration in the media.
For the press, we will encourage diversity by:
  Setting up a launch fund to assist new publications.
  Ensuring that all major wholesalers accept any lawful publication, and arrange
  for its proper supply and display, subject to a handling charge.
  Preventing acquisition of further newspapers by large press chains.
  Protecting freedom of expression by prohibiting joint control of the press,
  commercial radio and television.
  Breaking up major concentrations of press ownership, by setting an upper limit
  for the number of major publications in the hands of a single proprietor or
  press group.
  Replacing the Press Council with a stronger, more representative body.
In broadcasting, we Will aim to make both broadcasting itself, and the
organisations responsible, more accountable and representative - and to provide
greater public access. Our aim is to promote a more wide-ranging and genuine
pluralism in the media, and we set out our prop6sals in Labour's Programme 1982.
We will also seek to introduce a genuinely independent adjudication of
grievances and complaints. The licence fee will be phased out for pensioners,
during the lifetime of the Labour government.
The high standards of British public service broadcasting are threatened by Tory
plans to introduce cable TV on free-market principles. We will regulate
satellite and cable provision and foster the same principles of diversity and
pluralism as conventional broadcasting authorities. To avoid wasteful
duplication, we will entrust the provision of the national cable system to
British Telecom.
Animal protection
The Labour Party was the first major political party to publish a policy
statement, in 1978, on animal protection - Living Without Cruelty; and these
policies are reaffirmed in Labour's Programme 1982. We believe that all animals
- whether in the wild, domesticated or farmed - should be properly treated.
To achieve our aims we will transform the Farm Animal Welfare Council into a
Standing Royal Commission on Animal Protection. We will also urgently review the
1876 Cruelty to Animals Act. A high priority will be given to research into
alternatives to using live animals in experiments, and to restrictions on the
use of live animals in experiments - with proper control and supervision in
order to avoid pain.
Hare coursing, fox hunting and all forms of hunting with dogs will be made
illegal. This will not, however, affect shooting and fishing. The use of snares
will also be made illegal.
We will lay down clear conditions on freedom of movement for livestock; and we
will ensure that our legislation meets, at least, the requirements of the
European Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes. We
will also ban, over a phased period, all extreme livestock systems and introduce
legislation to ensure that animals are slaughtered as near as possible to the
point of production. We will ban the export of live food animals.
Animals kept in zoos, circuses and safari parks will be included in our animals
protection legislation. Health and safety at work legislation will be reviewed
in order to better protect people employed on such premises.
Britain and the Common Market
Geography and history determine that Britain is part of Europe, and Labour wants
to see Europe safe and prosperous. But the European Economic Community, which
does not even include the whole of Western Europe, was never devised to suit us,
and our experience as a member of it has made it more difficult for us to deal
with our economic and industrial problems. It has sometimes weakened our ability
to achieve the objectives of Labour's international policy.
The next Labour government, committed to radical, socialist policies for
reviving the British economy, is bound to find continued membership a most
serious obstacle to the fulfilment of those policies. In particular the rules of
the Treaty of Rome are bound to conflict with our strategy for economic growth
and full employment, our proposals on industrial policy and for increasing
trade, and our need to restore exchange controls and to regulate direct overseas
investment. Moreover, by preventing us from buying food from the best sources of
world supply, they would run counter to our plans to control prices and
inflation.
For all these reasons, British withdrawal from the Community is the right policy
for Britain - to be completed well within the lifetime of the parliament. That
is our commitment. But we are also committed to bring about withdrawal in an
amicable and orderly way, so that we do not prejudice employment or the prospect
of increased political and economic co-operation with the whole of Europe.
We emphasise that our decision to bring about withdrawal in no sense represents
any weakening of our commitment to internationalism and international co
operation. We are not 'withdrawing from Europe'. We are seeking to extricate
ourselves from the Treaty of Rome and other Community treaties which place
political burdens on Britain. Indeed, we believe our withdrawal will allow us to
pursue a more dynamic and positive international policy - one which recognises
the true political and geographical spread of international problems and
interests. We will also seek agreement with other European governments - both in
the EEC and outside - on a common strategy for economic expansion.
The process of withdrawal
On taking office we will open preliminary negotiations with the other EEC member
states to establish a timetable for withdrawal; and we will publish the results
of these negotiations in a White Paper. In addition, as soon as possible after
the House assembles, we will introduce a Repeal Bill: first, in order to amend
the 1972 European Communities Act, ending the powers of the Community in the UK;
and second, to provide the necessary powers to repeal the 1972 Act, when the
negotiations on withdrawal are completed.
Following the publication of the White Paper, we will begin the main
negotiations on withdrawal. Later, when appropriate and in the same parliament,
we will use our powers to repeal the 1972 Act and abrogate the Treaty of
Accession - thus breaking all of our formal links with the Community. Britain
will at this point withdraw from the Council of Ministers and from the European
Parliament.
There will need to be a period of transition, to ensure a minimum of disruption
- and to phase in any new agreements we might make with the Community. This will
enable us to make all the necessary changes in our domestic legislation. Until
these changes in UK law have taken place, the status quo as regards particular
items of EEC legislation will remain. And this period will, of course, extend
beyond the date when we cease, formally, to be members.
The international dimension
The Labour Party is working to create a democratic socialist society in Britain,
but we realise to achieve this we must enjoy the fullest international
co-operation. There is a real interdependence between nations, and, if Britain
under Labour is not to stand on the sidelines, we must co-operate to survive.
Our foreign policy is a logical extension of our work at home.
A deep crisis now afflicts the world economy. In the developed world, recession
has meant lengthening dole queues and a falling standard of life; for the
peoples of the Third World, recession has added to an already intolerable burden
of poverty. Unlike the Tories, Labour believes that there is a way out of the
crisis, and that we need not accept an international status quo so manifestly
riddled with injustice, inefficiency and waste. Labour will pursue and win
international support for policies designed to stimulate trade, investment, and
growth; and we shall work inside the appropriate institutions to end the
financial chaos which now threatens the stability of so many countries. There
can be no sure prospect of peace in a world wracked by an enduring economic
crisis. Labour's policies will help bring that crisis to an end.
Labour recognises the urgent need to restore détente and dialogue between the
states and the peoples of the world. We will actively pursue dialogue with the
Soviet Union and China, and will urge the American government to do so. We will
work consistently for peace and disarmament, and devote all our efforts to
pulling the world back from the nuclear abyss. Labour will dedicate some of the
resources currently wasted on armaments to projects designed to promote both
security and human development.
An essential difference between the Labour and the Tory approach is that we have
a foreign policy that will help liberate the peoples of the world from
oppression, want and fear. We seek to find ways in which social and political
progress can be achieved and to identify the role that Britain can play in this
process.
Our objectives cannot be pursued in isolation; we will work with the
international agencies, friendly governments, and with socialist parties and
genuine liberation movements in order to convert these objectives into concrete
achievements.
Disarmament - the international context
The pursuit of peace, development and disarmament is central to our policy. We
wish to strengthen the process of détente, which means the easing of political
as well as military tension between East and West. A third world war would
destroy civilisation, yet the danger of a nuclear holocaust grows alarmingly.
Labour is determined that Britain should play its full part in the struggle for
peace. Now in 1983, in what is a critical year for peace, we can begin to
influence events by the way we present the imperative case for disarmament. In
government we can carry that influence much further, by example and by common
action with others. We must use unilateral steps taken by Britain to secure
multilateral solutions on the international level. Unilateralism and
multilateralism must go hand ill hand if either is to succeed. It is for this
reason that we are against moves that would disrupt our existing alliances, but
are resolved on measures to enable Britain to pursue a non-nuclear defence
policy.
To achieve our paramount aim - stopping the nuclear arms race itself, and the
other arms races pursued beneath its shadow - we need stronger international
institutions. First and foremost is a United Nations organisation with real and
growing authority. Labour is determined to sustain and fortify the United
Nations. All our recent experience re-emphasises how necessary it is to have an
international Charter against aggression. It is a tragedy that the 1982 UN
Special Session on Disarmament was allowed to disband in failure and
disappointment. We shall work to recall a new session on a more ambitious and
hopeful basis. We will support the commitments of the UN Special Sessions on
Disarmament and the UN Committee on Disarmament.
We shall seek to restore the Final Document on Disarmament, approved by the 1978
United Nations Special Session, as the long-term objective. But, of course, as
the international tension sharpens, we must pursue other more immediate aims.
Labour has always opposed Soviet deployment of SS20s. We want to see the Geneva
talks on intermediate weapons succeed. Labour was arguing that they should begin
long before President Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher came round to the idea. It is
imperative that the SALT II agreement is ratified. We shall work for this. We
strongly support the reduction of strategic weapons in the START talks. We will
propose urgent action to make the Non-Proliferation Treaty effective and to keep
it effective. The uncontrolled proliferation of nuclear weapons would enormously
increase the danger to us all.
Following the steps taken by the last Labour government in such fields as non
proliferation and the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks, Britain must
again take a lead in disarmament negotiations.
Defence policy
The overriding task for Britain, as for the rest of the world, is to draw back
from the nuclear abyss. Britain must act on her own account as well as seeking
agreement with other countries on nuclear disarmament.
One immediate step our government must take is to insist on implementing the
recent United Nations call for a freeze on the production, deployment and
testing of nuclear weapons, and for a comprehensive test ban. That the Tory
government should have voted against these propositions in the United Nations is
deplorable, and betrays our country's capacity to play a leading role as an
advocate of world disarmament. Labour's proposals will help to restore that
opportunity.
Labour believes in effective defence through collective security but rejects the
present emphasis on nuclear weapons. Britain and her allies should have
sufficient military strength to discourage external aggression and to defend
themselves should they be attacked. Labour's commitment is to establish a
non-nuclear defence policy for this country. This means the rejection of any
fresh nuclear bases or weapons on British soil or in British waters, and the
removal of all existing nuclear bases and weapons, thus enabling us to make a
direct contribution to an eventually much wider nuclear-free zone in Europe.
However, all this cannot be done at once, and the way we do it must be designed
to assist in the task to which we are also committed - securing nuclear
disarmament agreements with other countries and maintaining co operation with
our allies.
The most pressing objective must be to prevent the deployment here or elsewhere
in Western Europe of Cruise or Pershing missiles. This deployment would mark a
new and dangerous escalation in the nuclear arms race. It would make the
achievement of effective disarmament agreements covering these and other weapons
much more difficult in the future. We will therefore not permit the siting of
Cruise missiles in this country and will remove any that are already in place.
The next Labour government will cancel the Trident programme. Apart from the
huge, persisting and distorting burden it would impose on our defence budget and
our economy as a whole, it would not offer security but would rather help to
intensify the arms race. We will propose that Britain's Polaris force be
included in the nuclear disarmament negotiations in which Britain must take
part. We will, after consultation, carry through in the lifetime of the next
parliament our non-nuclear defence policy.
Labour believes in collective security. The next Labour government will maintain
its support for NATO, as an instrument of détente no less than of defence. We
wish to see NATO itself develop a non-nuclear strategy. We will work towards the
establishment of a new security system in Europe based on mutual trust and
confidence, and knowledge of the objectives and capabilities of all sides. The
ultimate objective of a satisfactory relationship in Europe is the mutual and
concurrent phasing out of both NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
We oppose any attempt to expand the role of the alliance into other continents.
We condemn the doctrine that nuclear war can be limited, and the notion that
somehow the West must catch up with a supposed nuclear superiority in the East.
We are opposed to the introduction into Europe of any new nuclear systems such
as the neutron bomb. We oppose, too, the storage, research and production of
chemical and biological weapons, and call for the withdrawal of all forward
stocks of chemical weapons.
Labour will reduce the proportion of the nation's resources devoted to defence
so that the burden we bear will be brought into line with that of the other
major European NATO countries, without increasing the reliance on nuclear
weapons. A Labour government will plan to ensure that savings in military
expenditure do not lead to unemployment for those working in defence industries.
We shall give material support and encouragement to plans for industrial
conversion so that the valuable resources of the defence industries can be used
for the production of useful goods.
The emphasis of our defence priorities in the 1980s and 1990s must be to create
military forces that are clearly equipped and deployed for defensive purposes,
and tailored more to Britain's geography and economic resources. This will mean
maintaining adequate conventional forces, at present threatened by the
extravagant expenditure on Trident.
We are alarmed by the growth of the arms trade. Labour will limit Britain's arms
sales abroad and ban the supply of arms to repressive regimes such as South
Africa, El Salvador, Chile, Argentina and Turkey. We will not supply arms to
countries where the chances of international aggression or internal repression
would be increased. Labour will ensure that all arms sales are under strict
ministerial control, subject to parliamentary accountability.
The Commonwealth and the developing world
We shall continue to work for the peaceful and just settlement of disputes and
the strengthening of international organisations, particularly the Commonwealth,
as well as the United Nations. Labour has always attached a special significance
to the Commonwealth - a unique forum of nations, cutting across ethnic, cultural
and ideological barriers. We will strengthen Britain's political and material
commitment to the Commonwealth.
The future prosperity of Britain, as well as that of other industrialised
countries, is inextricably linked to the future of the developing world. At the
moment some 30 per cent of Britain's manufacturing exports are destined for
Third World countries with which we enjoy a very healthy balance of trade. If
their economies could be stimulated, the gain would be ours as well as theirs.
Countless British jobs have already come about as a consequence of our trading
relationship with the poorer countries. That relationship must be strengthened
and expanded in the interests of working people both in Britain and overseas.
The war that Labour will wage on poverty in Britain will be extended to the
developing world. A primary objective of the next Labour government's foreign
policy will be to help revive the North-South dialogue. That some 800,000,000
people should be condemned to a life of absolute poverty in the Third World is
an affront to any version of civilised values, as well as a constant threat to
international peace and stability.
Labour sets a high priority on attacking the causes of mass poverty. A Labour
government will reach the UN sponsored aid target of 0.7 per cent of Gross
National Product and work towards a further target of 1.0 per cent. We will also
re-establish the principle that aid must be used in the interests of the poorest
people in the poorest countries and, in our efforts to bring this about, we will
fund as appropriate, both governments and independent organisations. Labour will
set up once again a separate Ministry of Overseas Development with a cabinet
minister.
Labour will plan an expansion of trade with the developing world and will work
to bring about changes in the international trading system that will be of
benefit to poor countries, allowing them to receive stable prices for their
commodity exports and to diversify their production. In trade agreements, Labour
will insist upon workers' rights and will bring in legislation to control the
activities of British-based multinational companies operating overseas.
Labour believes that, in order to enhance the prospects of the Third World
economies, it will be vital to ensure that organisations such as the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund receive adequate funding from the world
community, and provide loans in a way that, taking into account the economic
difficulties faced by each developing country, will improve the condition of
their peoples.
There is much Britain can do to lift people out of absolute poverty, and a
Labour Britain will once again speak out in solidarity with the poor and the
oppressed everywhere.
We will ensure that provision for overseas students is based on a major
expansion of the ODA programme for student sponsorship giving preference to
entrants on grounds of origin, income level and availability of courses in
Britain and elsewhere.
The Law of the Sea
Labour welcomes the recently concluded United Nations Conference on the Law of
the Sea and fully supports the UNCLOS proposal for a new international regime
covering every aspect of ocean use. Unlike either the Tory government or the
Reagan administration, Labour will endorse the Law of the Sea, which we see as a
crucial element in the North-South dialogue, and will ensure that Britain
participates actively in the future progress of UNCLOS.
Near and Middle East
The Labour Party is committed to the promotion of peace, democracy and socialism
in the Middle East, and to the principle of national self-determination. The
Arab-Israeli conflict remains a major element in the continuing conflict and
tension in the region, through not the only one. The core of the conflict is the
struggle between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples for the realisation of
national self-determination.
We shall therefore:
  Support the right of all Israelis to live in peace and security in the state
  of Israel, within secure internationally recognised borders.
  Support the right of Palestinians to self determination, including the
  establishment of a Palestinian state.
The suffering of the Lebanese people and their continued occupation by foreign
forces demands our attention, and we shall work for the restoration of the
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Lebanon, and play a
full part in its reconstruction.
The Turkish dictatorship is of special concern to Britain, given Turkish
membership of NATO and its status in Europe. We deplore the constitution imposed
upon the Turkish people and will work for the restoration of freedom and
democracy. Until this is achieved we shall oppose assistance to the Turkish
junta.
Labour is deeply concerned by the continuing violation of human rights
throughout the Middle East. Labour will do what it can to help those struggling
for freedom, democracy, civil and trade union rights.
We support genuine guarantees for the independent, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Cyprus, and the pursuit of intercommunal discussions sponsored by
the UN for as long as both communities are committed to those talks.
Africa
We are totally opposed to apartheid and will unequivocally support its
opponents, giving financial and material assistance to the liberation movements
in South Africa and SWAPO of Namibia. Labour will also work with our trade union
colleagues to assist the non-racial trade unions in. South Africa.
We will carry through a systematic programme of economic disengagement from
South Africa by supporting comprehensive mandatory sanctions at the UN and
curtailing our economic relations with the regime. The details of our policy
towards Southern Africa are set out in Labour's Programme 1982.
Latin America
Latin America is a continent in crisis. The world recession and severe financial
difficulties have added to the burden of already frail economies. Democracy is
established in very few countries; torture and death are instruments of control
in many areas.
Central America is of particular concern. Treated for decades by the United
States as its backyard, the countries of this region have almost without
exception failed to establish a tradition of representative democracy. Millions
of people have endured a lifetime of oppression and deprivation. In recent
years, the pressure for social change to respond to basic needs has grown
intense, but has met with the firm resistance of the wealthy and the powerful,
invariably backed by Washington. This is true of El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Guatemala. Labour rejects US policy in Central America. Regrettably, the Tory
government has connected Britain with that policy by its slavish support for
everything the Reagan administration says and does. This applies even in the
case of Guatemala, which the US is re-arming, when it lays claim to Belize, to
whose defence we are committed.
Labour will do everything in its power to weaken Latin America's repressive
governments by, for example, withdrawing diplomatic representation, opposing
multilateral loans, banning arms sales and drawing international attention to
human rights violations. Our detailed policy is set out in Labour's Programme
1982.
Falkland Islands
Mrs. Thatcher's policy of Fortress Falklands is imposing an intolerable burden
both on the British people and on the inhabitants of the Falklands themselves.
The war, which wiser policies could have avoided, has already cost us
&pound;1,000 million. On top of that the Conservative government plans to spend
&pound;600 million a year for the indefinite future on garrisoning the islands -
£1 1/2 million per year for every Falklands family.
With four British servicemen on the islands to every adult male Falklander, the
traditional way of life of this rural community is being destroyed. Yet at the
same time Mrs. Thatcher is allowing British firms to equip warships for the
Argentine dictatorship and is lending money to General Bignone to spend on arms.
A Labour government would not sell arms to any Argentine government which was
hostile to Britain or denied civil rights and democratic freedoms to its own
people. Labour believes that Britain must restore normal links between the
Falklands and the Latin American mainland, and that the United Nations must be
involved in finding a permanent settlement of the problem.
Asia
Emotional as well as political ties exist between Britain and many of the
countries of Asia. It was the 1945 Labour government which gave independence to
India and Pakistan.
Labour is concerned about the suppression of human and civil rights in many of
the countries of Asia, and we will support every extension of democracy in the
region. A Labour government will end military involvement with those countries
that have repressive regimes.
The Labour Party is concerned that the Tory policy on overseas students' fees
has already affected the ability of students from Asia, as well as elsewhere, to
undertake courses in Britain. Steps will be taken to improve the position, as
laid out in a previous section.
Labour believes in a closer understanding with China, and hopes that China can
become more directly involved in international discussions on peace, disarmament
and the world economy. We will hold talks with China with the aim of securing a
peaceful and prosperous future for the people of Hong Kong.
Japan is a major power in the world economy. We hope to persuade Japan to play a
more active part in a concerted expansion of the economies of the industrial
nations, and to remove the obstacles that her trade policies now create. We also
hope that Japan will help to bridge the division between North and South by
increasing her aid to the Third World.
Human rights
Labour gives the highest priority to the protection of human dignity, civil
rights, democracy and freedom, which will be reflected in all that a Labour
government does.
We uphold the rights of all nations to self-determination. Accordingly, we
condemn the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and US support for repressive regimes
in Central America. We warn against all military interventions contrary to the
UN Charter. We condemn violations of human rights wherever they occur, whether
in Poland, Turkey or Nigeria, and whatever the complexion of the government
concerned. Labour will further the cause of human rights in all international
organisations. We will press for suspension from NATO of any dictatorship.
We will protect the opponents of regimes from harassment by their government's
representatives in Britain. Our policy on refugees will be more compassionate
than that of the Tory government. We will not deport individuals who would face
arrest or death in their own countries.
We will also take into account human rights considerations when giving aid.
Official aid will not be given to governments that persistently violate civil
and trade union rights. Help will instead be given to the victims of repression.

British Labour Party election manifesto, 1987Labour Party: 1987
Britain will win with Labour



INTRODUCTION
BY THE LEADER OF THE LABOUR PARTY
Every election is a time of decision. But this General Election on June 11 faces
the British people with choices more sharp than at any time in the past fifty
years.
The choices are between Labour's programme of work for people and Tory policies
of waste of people: between investment in industrial strength, and acceptance of
industrial decline; between a Britain with competitive, modern industries, and a
Britain with a low tech, low paid, low security economy increasingly dependent
upon imports.
The election will decide whether we and our children are to live in a country
that builds high standards of care for all who need treatment for illness,
pensions in retirement, good grounding in education, fair chances to get on; or
in a country where the Conservatives go on running down the vital health,
education and social services of every community, imposing higher charges and
lower standards.
This election will decide whether our country is to be a United Kingdom or a
divided kingdom; one that is brought together by proper provision, prudent
investment and concern for the interests of the whole nation, or one that is
pulled apart by poverty, cuts, increased privilege for the richest and neglect
for the rest.
This election will decide whether we put our resources into the real defence
provided by a modern, well-equipped army, navy and airforce safeguarding our
country an d supporting NATO; or spend those sums on maintaining an ageing
system of nuclear weapons, while buying a new generation of missiles which
cannot give our country effective defence. It will decide whether Britain is
part of the international process of nuclear build down or ruled by a government
uniquely intent upon nuclear build-up.
We already know what a third term for Mrs Thatcher would mean for the people of
Britain.
Under the Tories there have been:
Eight years of record unemployment, relentless industrial closures and
redundancies, of flooding imports and shrunken investment.
Eight years of the highest ever tax burden on the family and the nation as VAT,
National Insurance, rates and fees have all been put up in a shift to taxes on
spending and employment.
Eight years of cuts and closures and charges, of intensified means tests and
reduced services.
Eight years of increased state control, of centralising government of abolition
of rights of representation and negotiation.
Eight years of rising crime, of greater insecurity on the streets and housing
estates and in the home.
Eight years of meanness towards the needy in our country and towards the
wretched of the world.
Eight years of growing division - in health in opportunity. in housing
conditions in work and in income - between regions communities classes.
families, white and black, rich and poor.
The Tories say they are 'proud of their record'. So proud indeed that they would
want to do more of the same if they were re-elected.
Their plans for a poll tax would penalise millions of families, pensioners and
young people. Their refusal to provide the resources needed for the Health
Service and their plans for imposing further payment and privatisation will hit
everyone in the service and everyone needing to use it.
They would, if they won power again, privatise water, electricity, steel and
other services, and industries built up by public investment over past years.
They want to impose penal increases in rents for private and public tenants.
They are committed to introducing compulsory labour for young unemployed people.

All this and worse would come with a third term of Tory government.
Britain cannot afford more of that run-down, sell-off and split-up, nor all the
costs and waste that they bring.
Britain does not have to.
Britain can stop the rot - but only by voting Labour.
There is no other way to prevent thirteen years of Thatcherism.
No party other than Labour can possibly win enough seats to form a government.
The Liberals and SDP know that. Their hope is to profit from confusion. To
divide the non-Conservative vote in such a way as to make them the 'hook' in a
'hung' Parliament and have power far beyond their responsibility.
And, while one of their leaders clearly favours an arrangement to sustain a
Conservative government, the other hasn't the strength to stop him.
That offers no way ahead for a nation that needs to get on with investing for
change, for quality, for confidence in the future.
Proper support for education, strengthened research and development and
long-term, low interest finance for industrial growth are all essential if
Britain is to gain the vitality necessary to outpace competitors who have been
building these assets for years.
They are essential too if we are to generate the wealth needed for the security,
care and opportunity fundamental to the individual freedom of women and men of
all ages and origins. When our country faces the common pressures on the
environment, the common dangers of crime, the common costs of unemployment,
under-investment and under-performance together, our country has every
commonsense reason to meet those challenges together.
That is democratic socialism in action. And just as a family uses its combined
spirit and resources to overcome crisis, so Britain can once again make common
cause to achieve common good.
Only a Labour government can give that lead. Only we are committed to such
concerted action. Only we believe that the whole nation should win and can win.
That is why Britain will win, with Labour.
Neil Kinnock



BRITAIN WILL WIN
Britain is crying out for change. Only a Labour government can bring it about.
Mending divisions, building new strengths will need determination and realistic
priorities.
Commonsense and the common interest require that the Tory philosophy of
selfishness and short-term gain is replaced by the democratic socialist
philosophy of community and caring, of investment in people and in production.
We must as a priority tackle the immediate tragedy and waste of unemployment. We
must commit resources to modernising and strengthening the industries and
services that earn Britain a living. We must ensure the continuity of expansion
that is necessary for a lasting economic recovery.
That is our strategy.
It begins from the understanding that people are Britain's most precious
resource. It is rooted in the confidence that, with the right skills, the right
equipment and the backing of a government that is committed to encouraging
enterprise and innovation, Britain's people can make our country more efficient,
more competitive and more socially just.
It is a message of hope and confidence - the alternative to the divisive and
dictatorial approach of the Conservatives.
We do not believe that everything could or should be done by government. But we
know, from our own history and from the example set by our competitors, that
national economic success cannot be achieved without government.
Britain will win with a Labour government that invests to enable people to use
their abilities and to stimulate modern training, research, development,
production and marketing. These are the ingredients of economic vitality, and
the foundations of fairness.



THE PRIORITY PROGRAMME
For our first two years in government we Will concentrate resources on the
essential tasks of combating unemployment and poverty In the course of that
action, we will strengthen the health, housing, education, social services and
crime-fighting services that are vital to social and economic well-being, and
begin to rebuild our manufacturing industry.
Clearly, all other programmes that require substantial public finance must take
lower priority in terms of timescale and public resources.
THE JOBS PROGRAMME
Immediately after the election the Labour Government will call together a
National Economic Summit to assess fully the condition of the economy and set
the recovery programme in motion - producing the jobs that need to be done by
people who need to do them in a country that wants them done.
The Summit will establish the first stage of the National Economic Assessment.
This will identify the concerted action that will need to be taken by
government, employers in the private and public sectors and trade unions to
increase investment, contain inflation and achieve sustained recovery.
We will reduce unemployment by one million in two years as the first instalment
in beating mass unemployment.
Half a million jobs will be generated in private industry and in the public
sector by the repairing and building of the houses, the hospitals and schools,
the transport improvements and sewers that the nation needs. This will be
achieved by public investment and by reducing employers' National Insurance
contribution in targeted areas.
Another 360,000 new jobs and training places will be created. These will provide
new skills for young people and adults - with proper opportunities for women.
A further 300,000 new jobs will improve the health and education services and
the neglected community and caring services. The depleted customs services will
be strengthened in the fight against drugs. The revenue and benefit departments
will be staffed to increase efficiency.
We will extend the voluntary Job Release Scheme to men over 60 so that those who
want to retire early vacate jobs for those who are currently unemployed. This
could take as many as 160,000 people out of unemployment and into work.
THE ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAMME
The spread of poverty in the past eight years has stained the whole nation, and
widened misery and disadvantage amongst old and young. Much of it is the result
of deliberate government policies. Millions of poor people endure it in despair.
Millions who are not poor regard it as a disgrace. The Labour government will
combat poverty directly.
We will immediately increase the single pension by £5 a week and the pension for
a married couple by £8, as the first step in re-establishing a link between
pensions and average earnings or living costs, whichever is the most favourable
to pensioners. We will begin the abolition of the TV licence fee for pensioners.

We will provide pensioners on supplementary benefit and others on low incomes
with a £5 winter premium to help with fuel bills. We will begin discussions with
the fuel industries with a view to phasing out standing charges.
We will fully restore the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme as part of the
process of achieving our objective of a pensions level of one-third average
earnings for single people and half average earnings for married couples.
We will restore and increase the death grant.
We will increase child benefit by £3 a week for all children, raise the
allowance to the first child by £7.36, and increase one- parent family benefit
by £2.20.
We will restore and increase the maternity grant.
We will start to phase in a new disability income scheme and provide resources
to give special support to young people with disabilities. Our special Minister
for the Disabled will be put in charge of our programme for the disabled.
We will extend the long-term supplementary benefit rate to the long-term
unemployed.
We will implement a comprehensive strategy for ending low pay, notably by the
introduction of a statutory national minimum wage. This will be of particular
benefit to women workers, and will help lift families out of poverty.
THE ANTI-CRIME PROGRAMME
We will introduce crime prevention grants for home-owners and tenants.
We will work with the police to get more police on the beat. Uniformed police
officers will be relieved of non-law-and-order tasks which take them away from
crime prevention, pursuit and detection.
We will reverse the Tory cuts in the number of those who can claim criminal
injuries compensation. We will give the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board
more staff to cut the all-time record 64,000 queue awaiting compensation.
PAYING FOR THE RECOVERY PROGRAMME
These immediate programmes will cost £6 billion a year net for the first two
years. We will pay for them by:
  Putting directly into generating 300,000 jobs the money that would be used up
  by the Thatcher government on its 2p income tax bribe.
  Adopting the same practice as most successful industrial countries and
  companies, by prudently borrowing £3 billion for useful wealth generating
  national investment.
We will reverse the extra tax cuts which the richest 5 per cent have received
from the Tory government and allocate that money instead to the most needy. We
will also bring forward other reforms to capital taxation - including the
introduction of a wealth tax, which, whilst applying to only the wealthiest one
per cent of the population, will, over the years, bring a significant
contribution from those in our society best able to pay.
CHANGES WITHOUT CHARGES
Apart from legislating where necessary for the Recovery Programme, the new
Parliament will swiftly enact many other worthwhile measures. These will cost
little to implement but produce significant improvement in the quality of
administration, provision and response to the needs of ordinary citizens.
They will include:
  A Minister for Women, with a place in the Cabinet.
  A Freedom of Information Act, to be accompanied by the repeal of Section Two
  of the Official Secrets Act.
  Parliamentary scrutiny of the Security Services.
  Appointment of an Education Ombudsman.
  Appointment of an Ombudsman for Police Complaints.
  An Energy Efficiency Agency to co-ordinate conservation programmes for
  domestic and industrial energy users.
  A new Ministry of Environmental Protection.
PROGRAMME FOR A FIVE-YEAR PARLIAMENT
Labour's Programme for Recovery will be the start of a strategy for a full
Parliament. We have to halt the decline in manufacturing industry, not only to
generate jobs and increase our world trade share but to create the wealth to
finance the rescue and expansion of education, health, housing and the social
services.
NEW STRENGTH FOR INDUSTRY
For eight years British industry has been left to drift and decline Our oil
revenues have been wasted and the City has concentrated upon short-term
movements of capital at the expense of British manufacturing industry. The huge
capital outflow of £110 billion since 1979 is ruinous evidence of the Tories'
lack of concern for the strength of the British economy.
Labour is committed to rebuilding our industrial base. Our country must make the
best use of computers and information technology to develop the modern means of
making a living as the oil runs down and the pressures of technical change and
international competition intensify.
We will:
  Establish a capital repatriation scheme using the tax system to attract and
  retain British savings and investment in Britain.
  Set up the British Industrial Investment Bank, with strong bases in Scotland,
  Wales and English regions, to ensure finance for industry where it is needed,
  when it is needed and on terms which encourage long term development.
  Implement a dynamic and properly funded regional policy. This will include the
  establishment of Regional Development Agencies (starting with the North,
  North-West, Yorkshire and Humberside); the promotion of local and regional
  enterprise boards; greater scope for local authorities to participate
  constructively in economic development; and creating high technology
  innovation centres throughout Britain.
  Create a new Ministry of Science and Technology to promote a major increase in
  research and development.It will co-ordinate the activities and budgets of
  government departments involved in these areas and will encourage, in
  conjunction with industry and the scientific community, the full application
  of science to industrial processes and products.
  We shall extend social ownership by a variety of means, as set out in Labour's
  detailed proposals. In particular, we will set up British Enterprise, to take
  a socially owned stake in high-tech industries and other concerns where public
  funds are used to strengthen investment. Social ownership of basic utilities
  like gas and water is vital to ensure that every individual has access to
  their use and that the companies contribute to Britain's industrial recovery,
  for instance, by buying British. We shall start by using the exist mg 49 per
  cent holding in British Telecom to ensure proper influence in their decisions.
  Private shares in BT and British Gas will be converted into special new
  securities. These will be bought and sold in the market in the usual way and
  will carry either a guaranteed return, or dividends linked to the company's
  growth.
  Encourage the establishment and success of co-operatives of all forms.
  Strengthen the Department of Trade and Industry as the spearhead of this new
  national industrial strategy.
  Bring in a stronger regulatory framework to ensure honest practice in the City
  of London and introduce new safeguards on mergers, takeovers and monopolies to
  protect our national industrial, technological and research and development
  interests.
PLAN FOR TRAINING
For modern, wealth-creating industry we need a well-trained workforce. British
industry now carries out less than half of the training of our main competitors.
Labour will therefore establish a national training programme to bring about a
major advance in the spread and standard of skills.
For young people we will establish an integrated, high quality Foundation
Programme that will guarantee for all 16 year olds at least two years of
education, training and work experience according to their needs.
The Adult Skillplan will develop lifelong training and education for everyone
needing to supplement and update skills in work, with particular emphasis given
to training for women.
The Jobs, Enterprise and Training Programme will expand existing programmes for
unemployed people with a guarantee of a job or new skill for the long-term
unemployed.
A SENSIBLE ENERGY POLICY
Efficiency in industry and security in the community both depend on reliable and
safe supplies of energy available at acceptable cost. Britain's oil reserves
have a limited life. We have huge reserves of coal which will last for
centuries. Labour's co-ordinated energy programme will ensure the most sensible
use of our reserves while protecting our environ ment and stimulating
employment.
Labour will initiate a major energy conservation programme and ensure that
Britain develops the full potential of its coal, oil and gas resources, whilst
gradually diminishing Britain's dependence upon nuclear energy.
We will invest substantially in research into, and development of, the renewable
energy resources as part of the alternative means of power.
We will not proceed with the building of the proposed Pressurised Water Reactor
at Sizewell.
We share national concern about the problem of nuclear waste. We will ensure a
safe future for Sellafield and develop a new strategy for the monitoring,
storage and disposal of nuclear waste.
Labour will take effective steps to improve the service provided by the energy
industry to energy consumers. These will cover quality of supply, frequency of
metering, general service arrangements and proper provision for the disabled,
those in poverty and others with special needs.
A PROSPEROUS AGRICULTURE
A more efficient agricultural industry can clearly make a valuable contribution
to Britain's recovery. We will support good environmental practices in
agriculture.
To give Britain's producers the backing they need, the burden of agricultural
support must be shifted from consumers. The direction of support must be shifted
away from blanket support for commodities, towards helping the farmers who need
it most, such as those who work in the hills or on marginal land. To help bring
this about we will introduce new, long-term programmes for agriculture.
We will also help new farmers and young farmers by offering farms to rent. And
we will reverse the cuts in the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service
and research.
FREEDOM AND FAIRNESS FOR ALL BRITAIN'S PEOPLE
We are determined to make Britain a fairer and freer society.
To us and to the majority of the British people a civilised community is one in
which citizens band together to provide, out of community resources to which all
contribute, essential services like health, education and pensions that the
great majority of people can not afford to provide for themselves at time of
need.
When the Tories talk of freedom, they mean freedom for the few, for those who
can afford to buy privilege. What they mean, as their record so plainly shows,
is more tax cuts for the rich and less help for the poor and for that great
majority who are neither rich nor poor.
Labour's objective is to broaden and deepen the liberty of all individuals in
our community: to free people from poverty, exploitation and fear; to free them
to realise their full potential; to see that everyone has the liberty to enjoy
real chances, to make real choices.
It means collective provision for private use. The British people know that this
is the most effective way for them to secure their freedom as individuals whilst
meeting the moral obligations which they feel towards others and seeing that
fairness is a way of national life, not just a fine word.
These values are the essence of our democratic socialism.
INVESTING IN HEALTH
Labour's proudest achievement is the creation of the National Health Service.
The Conservatives voted against it then. All who use and value the service know
only too well how it has been neglected and downgraded by today's Tories.
Labour will establish the NHS in its rightful place as a high quality service
for the prevention and treatment of illness, free at the time of use to all who
need attention, equipped to meet the changing pressures of need as they relate,
for instance, to an aging population and the requirements of proper provision
for people suffering from mental illness.
The biggest single deficiency in the NHS today is the excessively high hospital
waiting lists which, under the Tories, are increasing year by year. We shall
speedily reduce them by computerising bed allocation, encouraging more
consultants to work full-time for the NHS and targeting increased resources
where waiting lists remain excessive.
The basis of the NHS is the Family Doctor Service We shall act to improve it,
with shorter GP patient lists, more convenient surgery hours, more choice and
information for patients.
We will develop local family health care teams and more local health centres.
Women's health care has been seriously neglected. Our Charter for Womens' Health
will include a network of Well-Women Clinics, and a computerised call and recall
screening system as a universal service for all women at risk of cervical and
breast cancer. We shall see that all women have the chance to see a woman doctor
if they choose.
We will step up the fight against AIDS by increasing research resources to find
a vaccine or cure and also ensure adequate resources for the supply of drugs
capable of arresting the affliction.
We will improve outpatient and emergency facilities and ambulance services and
repair and build hospitals. We intend to improve both the quantity and quality
of services for the National Health. The Tories have increased prescription
charges twelve fold. We will begin to reduce them with the purpose of securing
their eventual abolition.
Labour will ensure that nurses get proper and justified pay increases by right
and regularly, not exceptionally as pre-election sweeteners. Other hospital
staff, on whom the effective running of the service depends, must also be fairly
rewarded as part of the effective health team.
Privatisation means a Health Service run for profit rather than in the patients'
interests. Labour will end privatisation in the NHS, relieve the pressure on NHS
facilities by beginning to phase out pay beds and remove public subsidies to
private health.
A CARING COMMUNITY
The quality of life of the elderly and of disabled people can and must be
improved by community services. We believe that retirement should be comfortable
and interesting - a time of freedom and choice, not anxiety and loneliness. We
believe that disability should not be a disqualification from good standards of
living and liberty.
Apart from our commitment to higher pensions and the beginning of a new
disablement allowance, Labour will support the National Health Service and local
government in providing more meals on wheels, home helps, chiropody services and
health visitors.
We also recognise the immense contribution of the three million people - mostly
women - who care for their elderly, infirm and disabled relatives at home. They
save the community huge sums of money, often at considerable sacrifice to
themselves. The Labour government will consequently provide a carer's allowance
to give extra help to those who serve their loved ones and our society so well.
We appreciate and will support voluntary efforts that supplement services which
are essential to the community. We share the view of many who are engaged in
such efforts that they achieve best results working in the context of high
quality public provision.
EDUCATION FOR BRITAIN'S FUTURE
Our children are our future. We have a moral and material duty to see that
children and young people are fully equipped to deal with the complexities and
challenges which face them now and which they will meet as citizens; parents and
workers in the future.
They must be provided with a system of education that enables them to control
that future. We must see that it is democratic and just, that it is creative and
compassionate, and that it is one in which they can fully exploit the advantages
of science and technology with confidence and in safety.
In pursuit of those objectives, Labour will invest in education so that the
abilities of all children and adults from all home back grounds and in every
part of our country are discovered and nourished.
We will make nursery education available for all three- and four-year-olds whose
parents want this opportunity. We will make provision for smaller classes and
ensure that children have up-to-date books, equipment and buildings without
having to depend on fund-raising for those essentials.
The entitlement to free school meals and the restoration of nutritional
standards are, like the strengthening of the school health service, commitments
which are necessary to safeguard the physical and social wellbeing of growing
children.
We will see that teachers are recognised properly as well qualified
professionals, in their systems of rewards, in the procedures for negotiation of
their employment conditions and in participation in the development of
education.
In addition we shall work with local education authorities to secure a flexible
but clear core curriculum agreed at national level, a School Standards Council,
and a new profile of achievement recording individual progress through school
for all pupils. We will improve links between schools and home so that parents
and teachers act in partnership to foster the best interests of children.
We shall foster achievement with other policies such as providing proper funding
for the GCSE curriculum and examination, for improved supply of teachers and
equipment for science subjects so that girls as well as boys increase science
learning. There will be maintenance allowances for 16- to 18-year- olds whose
family circumstances would other wise impede their further education.
We will spread the provision of a comprehensive tertiary system of post-school
education.
These policies will all contribute to raising standards of performance in
schools. At the same time as we improve the quality of publicly provided
education, we shall end the 11 plus everywhere and stop the diverting of
precious resources that occurs through the Assisted Places Scheme and the public
subsidies to private schools.
Labour values the research and teaching contribution made by Britain's higher
education system. We will ensure that our universities and polytechnics get the
resources they need to restore and expand the opportunity for all qualified
young people seeking higher education to secure places. We will ensure that more
adults have access to higher education to give them the 'second chance' of
personal development
We will also invest in research in higher education, in order to provide the
facilities and opportunities necessary to sustain standards of excellence, to
retain and attract the highest talents and to encourage the industrial and
commercial application of research output.
Education for life through a well-funded adult education service will help to
provide the means by which rapid economic and social change can be embraced.
REAL CHOICE IN HOUSING
Public funding for housing has fallen by 60 per cent during Mrs Thatcher's eight
years in office. Far fewer homes are being built. Millions of dwellings are in
serious disrepair. Yet there is record unemployment among building workers. This
policy is immoral and grossly inefficient. Labour will reverse it. We will also
improve the quality of housing workmanship and establish a new system of
registration in the construction industry.
We will launch a major housebuilding and public and private sector housing
renovation drive as part of our jobs programme and to combat the problems of bad
housing, over crowding and homelessness. Owner occupiers will benefit from
increased availability of improvement grants.
We will maintain mortgage tax relief, at the standard rate of income tax. To
assist house-purchasers we will introduce a housing 'log book', giving each
dwelling's history, condition and construction so that purchasers will know
exactly what they are buying. This will be transferred with the sale.
For council tenants, we will maintain the right to buy. Local authorities, at
present limited by the Tories in using the receipts from council house sales,
will be required to use these proceeds to invest in new housing. For the
millions who choose to remain council tenants, we will give a legal right to be
consulted about rents, charges, repair and improvement programmes. Tenants'
associations will be given representation in the decision-making structure and a
say in spending budgets on their estates.
Groups of tenants who want to take over the running of their homes will have the
right to set up management co-operatives.
Leaseholders who own their homes will be given the legal right to acquire their
freeholds at fair prices and without the costly current impediments to that
right. Leaseholders in flats will get the legal right to hire and fire the
managing agents in blocks of flats. They will be empowered to have the
freeholder's accounts examined by an auditor of their choice and be given the
legal right to extend their lease.
Security of tenure will be protected for private tenants. These tenants will be
given a legal right to get repairs done.
PROTECTING OUR PEOPLE
The Thatcher government has broken its promises on law and order. Last year
4,311,000 crimes were committed in Britain. The clear-up rate fell to 32 per
cent. Millions of women are scared to go out at night. Many old people lock
themselves into their homes. Drug trafficking is increasing.
Labour will take urgent action to make people safer.
Our crime prevention programme will:
  Help local councils to implement a Safer Streets policy, with more
  street-lighting, more caretakers, park-keepers and other public employees
  whose presence deters crime.
  Bring in a Safe Estates Policy, assisting councils to provide stronger locks,
  stouter doors and vandal-proof windows for tenants and home-owners -
  especially older citizens - who have difficulty in meeting the costs of such
  security improvements.
  Introduce a Safer Transport policy, to protect passengers and crews, including
  better services, especially at night, adequate staffing, better sited bus
  stops and well-lit stations with alarm buttons.
  Lay down crime prevention standards for buildings, open spaces and vehicles to
  combat vandalism and to deter criminals.
  Combat violence against women - specially domestic violence - by seeing that
  the laws that already exist against beating and abuse are vigorously enforced.

Our victim support programme will fund a national network of victim support
schemes, providing practical help to victims of all crime, ranging from victims
of rape and child abuse to mugging and burglary victims.
We shall assist family and support groups in their efforts to work with
professionals in the health, education and other services and within the
community to deal with the great and growing problem of drug abuse.
Locally elected police authorities will be given clear statutory responsibility
with the police to enforce the law and uphold the Queen's peace. The police
themselves will remain responsible for all operational matters.
Fraud in the City of London is a serious crime. Too many get away with it.
Labour will bring in effective regulation by establishing an independent
statutory commission.
MAKING TRAVEL EASIER
Efficient, inexpensive public transport is essential in any society. Tory
policies have made travel more difficult by cutting services and pushing up
fares. Deregulation of buses has brought chaos to many parts of the country both
in towns and cities and in the rural areas where efficient and cheap public
transport is so important.
Labour will invest to co-ordinate and improve bus and rail services, which will
improve travel and reduce congestion. There will be Local Transport Plans for
every area.
Action will be taken to keep fares down. There will be good concessionary fare
schemes for local travel for pensioners and people with disabilities.
We shall promote services for those with special needs, such as dial-a-ride and
taxicard schemes offering cheap travel for the disabled.
We shall invest to ensure a continuing future for British Rail Engineering as a
high-quality supplier both for British Rail and to world markets.
A SAFER ENVIRONMENT
The countryside and the urban areas all suffer from pollution and the misuse of
the environment. Labour will establish a Ministry of Environmental Protection to
take positive action to safeguard the quality and safety of life.
We will:
  Set up an Environmental Protection Service and a Wildlife and Countryside
  Service.
  Extend the planning system to cover agricultural forestry and water
  developments requiring them, and industry, to take account of environmental
  considerations.
  Invest more in land reclamation and cleaning up, in recycling and
  conservation, in development of new products, processes and pollution control
  equipment. This will not only make the country cleaner but will create jobs as
  well.
  Take action to deal with acid rain.
  Stop radio-active discharges into our seas and oppose the dumping of nuclear
  waste at sea.
  Provide for better monitoring, inspection and enforcement of pollution
  control, to cover areas ranging from air pollution to beaches, from hazardous
  chemicals to food additives, and from water quality to vehicle emissions.
  Protect green belts and other specially designated areas.
  Bring in a new Wildlife and Countryside Act and provide for public access to
  all common land, mountain, moor and heath.
  End all forms of organised hunting with hounds. Special account will be taken
  of the conditions applying in National Parks. These changes will not affect
  shooting and fishing.
  Update animal protection legislation - for example, to eliminate unnecessary
  experimenting on live animals.
STRENGTHENING DEMOCRACY
We will seek to strengthen parliamentary democracy and introduce state aid for
political parties, along the lines of the Houghton Report.
We shall establish a new democratically-elected strategic authority for London
and consult widely about the most effective regional structure of government and
administration in England and Wales.
SCOTLAND
We shall legislate in the first Parliamentary session to establish a
democratically-elected Scottish Assembly in Edinburgh. This will have a wide
range of powers over health, education and housing and over significant aspects
of industrial and economic policy. It will take responsibility for changes in
the structure of Scottish local government.
WALES
Wales and the Welsh economy will clearly benefit from Labour's programme for
investment in jobs and vital services. In addition, the Welsh Development Agency
will be given greater powers and funds and there will be a new Wales Economic
Planning Council. Welsh agriculture will benefit from our measures to help the
livestock farmers especially the marginal and hill farmers.
A separate Arts Council for Wales will be established and the development of the
use and choice of the Welsh language will be encouraged.
NORTHERN IRELAND
Labour's policies for economic renewal are essential to combat the record
unemployment and social deprivation in Northern Ireland and to encourage the
economic security which is fundamental to the development of harmony and trust
in the community.
We believe in a united Ireland: to be achieved peacefully, democratically, and
by consent. We consequently support the Anglo-Irish Agreement and its commitment
that there should be no change in the constitutional position of Northern
Ireland without the con sent of the majority of the people who live there. No
group or party will be allowed to exercise a veto on political development, or
on policies designed to win consent.
We will combat para-military violence from wherever it comes. We will promote
discussions aimed at encouraging mutual confidence and eliminating conflict
whilst ensuring that the respective identities and basic rights of both
communities will be protected. We will replace present strip-searching practice
with more effective and acceptable security measures.
LOCAL DEMOCRACY
The Tory government has undermined local democracy and plans to continue to
diminish the importance of votes in local elections.
It has made huge cuts in rate support grant and imposed financial penalties to
prevent councils maintaining and improving the quality of essential local
services. Employment, and sensible and sensitive investment in local communities
and their services, have been damaged.
Labour will restore the right of councils to decide their own policies and
plans, which will be subject to the decisions of local people at annual local
elections.
We will halt the cuts in rate support grant and end financial penalties. We will
make the legal liabilities of councillors similar to those of Ministers and
Company Directors by ending surcharge and disqualification except for criminal
offences.
We will abolish the Rates Act and repeal the legislation which established the
poll tax in Scotland.
We will give local authorities the necessary powers to enable them to build on
existing successful initiatives for enterprise and employment, to develop new
technologies and to train young people.
Labour will examine the structure of local government to ensure that it is
democratic and effective. We will establish a new Quality Commission to ensure
the spread of 'best practice', efficiency and high standards of local authority
provision and response to the public.
NEW LIFE FOR INNER CITIES
Except where it has turned areas over to speculators so that they can create
luxury accommodation at astronomical prices, this government has left inner-city
areas to rot.
Experience has shown that the Conservatives' City Action Teams have never had
the means or the purpose of making any real impact on inner city problems.
Tory cuts in funding and in housing, together with mass unemployment, have
turned too many of our urban areas into dingy, hopeless places.
Yet the people who live there, given the chance, have the zest and initiative to
make these areas thrive socially and economically.
Labour will launch a drive against inner-city deprivation both as a way of
generating employment and as a means of making such areas safer and better
places to live.
Labour's approach will be to develop the partnership between central and local
government, with the direct participation of the voluntary and private sectors.
We will:
  Give local authorities in key areas the power to declare Public Action Zones.
  In these areas, local councils will have additional resources and powers to
  undertake programmes of investment. Land will be identified for housing, jobs
  and amenities and extra government resources allocated to help with
  comprehensive regeneration. Local people will be fully consulted about their
  needs and ideas.
  Strengthen the Urban Programme and Partnership Schemes.
  Make Urban Development Grants available for local needs.
  Increase resources for reclaiming derelict land.
RURAL AREAS
Under the Tories, the problems of the rural areas have become steadily more
serious - the lack of jobs, the poor housing, and the loss of buses, post
offices, shops and schools.
Labour will give our rural communities the chance to thrive again. Our policies
include better public transport, new mobile facilities for health care and
social services and extra help to keep open local schools and post offices.
ENHANCING RIGHTS, INCREASING FREEDOM
Under the Conservatives, Britain has become a harsher place. Freedoms built up
over generations have been weakened or removed. Labour will restore and enhance
those freedoms in a Britain where life can be more pleasant and fulfilling.
We believe that positive steps are needed to help women and ethnic minorities
get a fair deal, and to attain more democracy in the workplace. In addition, we
will take steps to ensure that homosexuals are not discriminated against.
WOMEN'S RIGHTS
More than half of Britain's people - the women of our country - are still denied
many essential rights. Labour's Ministry for Women will make sure that, in
framing their policies, all government departments listen and respond to women's
needs and concerns.
In particular, women must have the right to work and equal rights at work. In
addition to our new provision for training opportunities and protection against
discrimination, Labour will help the large number of women who are part-time
workers. We will legislate for them to have the same hourly rates, rights to
sick pay, paid holidays and job security as full-time workers.
We will give homeworkers the status and rights of employees; introduce effective
laws for equal pay for work of equal value; provide better-paid leave for
parents when their child is born; and encourage a shorter, more flexible working
week.
DEMOCRACY IN THE WORKPLACE
Workers' rights have been eroded, or in some cases removed entirely, during the
Thatcher years. Labour's policy for new rights and responsibilities means
legislation to foster good industrial relations and democratic participation in
industry and trade unions. We believe that the law should be used to enlarge,
not diminish, the freedom of workers to control their environment.
We will:
  Replace Tory legislation that gives employers and non-unionists the means to
  frustrate legitimate trade union activity. New laws will strengthen the legal
  rights of representation, bargaining and trade unionism that are essential in
  a modern democracy.
  Improve the protection available against unfair dismissal. We shall make the
  legislation apply from the time of employment. Reinstatement will be the
  normal outcome of a successful finding of unfair treatment. We will ensure
  that justice is done in cases where miners have been unfairly dismissed.
  Extend employment protection to all workers, including part-timers.
  Improve statutory protection in respect of health and safety at work.
  Restore provision for fair pay, such as the Fair Wages Resolution, Schedule 11
  of the 1975 Employment Protection Act and the powers of the Wages Councils.
  Strengthen ACAS to put more emphasis on conciliation and arbitration.
  Take steps to develop stable and effective negotiating machinery, promote
  trade union membership and organisation, and encourage union recognition by
  employers.
  Restore the right to belong to a trade union to every employee - including
  those at GCHQ.
  Ensure that the law guarantees the essential legal freedom of workers and
  their unions to organise effective industrial action.
  Provide a statutory framework of measures to underpin the participative rights
  of union members, for example by laying down general principles for inclusion
  in union rule books. These will be based on a right for union members to have
  a secret ballot on decisions relating to strikes, and for the method of
  election of union executives to be based on a system of secret ballots.
  In consultation with the TUC, we will establish a new independent tribunal,
  presided over by a legally-qualified person. This will have the duty of acting
  on complaints by union members if they consider that these statutory
  principles have been breached.
EQUALITY FOR ETHNIC MINORITIES
All the people of this country - whatever their race, colour or religion - must
enjoy the full rights of citizenship.
Our policies for employment, education, housing, health care, local government
and much else will clearly be of benefit to people of the ethnic minorities as
they will be to the whole community.
In addition, Labour will take firm action to promote racial equality, to attack
racial discrimination and to encourage contract compliance and other positive
means of ensuring equity for all citizens. We will strengthen the law on public
order to combat racial hatred and take firm action against the growing menace of
racial attacks. We will make prosecution easier in order to encourage the
reporting of offences.
Labour's policy of firm and fair immigration control will ensure that the law
does not discriminate on the basis of race, colour or sex.
A BETTER DEAL FOR CONSUMERS
When people make a purchase, they often feel they are treated unfairly, or even
cheated. Labour's Charter for Consumers will provide proper safeguards suited to
modern conditions.
There will be firmer protection against unsafe goods. We will make producers
strictly liable for defective products.
We will provide easier means of redress for purchasers and stiffer penalties to
deter illegal practices.
We will take action to make sure that public bodies respond better to the needs
and complaints of people who use their services.
We will bring in a statutory code of advertising practice. There will be powers
to order the correction of misleading advertisements.
We will improve access to legal services where necessary.
There will be more safeguards for customers when companies go bankrupt.
TOWARDS A FULLER LIFE
Life is not only work. Labour will make pro vision for the co-ordination and
development of leisure amenities and the leisure and cultural industries.
Our Support Sport programme will provide more resources for physical education
and training through more playing fields and facilities, better equipment and
well-trained teachers and instructors. We will nourish special talents and
encourage wider participation in sport.
We will encourage schools to open up their recreational facilities to the whole
community and prevent the selling off of school and other sports grounds.
We will set up a Sports Trust to channel resources into the development of
community sporting facilities and the attraction of major international sporting
events to Britain.
We will establish a Ministry for the Arts and Media with responsibility for the
arts, crafts, public libraries, museums, film, publishing, the press, the record
industry, the development of broadcasting and access to it, fashion, design,
architecture and the heritage. The Home Office will remain responsible for
regulatory and statutory powers in relation to broadcasting.
The development of central and local government support for the arts, culture
and entertainment is essential to the extension of choice, access and
participation, and to the development of the related industries.
We will protect the independence of the BBC and the independent broadcasting
organisations. We reject subscription TV for the BBC and the auctioning of ITV
franchises.
We will legislate to ensure that ownership and control of the press and
broadcasting media are retained by citizens of Britain and to place limits on
the concentration of owner ship. We will strengthen the Press Council and set up
a launch fund to assist new publications in order to encourage the diversity
necessary in a healthy democracy.
MODERN BRITAIN IN A MODERN WORLD
The globe is torn by strife and oppression A Labour Britain must play its part
in promoting freedom and reducing conflict.
Labour will play a full part in the United Nations Organisation and the
Commonwealth.
Under the Conservatives, Britain picks and chooses which authoritarian countries
to condemn and which to befriend. Labour will stand up for freedom wherever it
is oppressed - whether in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia or Africa.
The Thatcher government has made no real effort to foster freedom in South
Africa and Namibia. Labour will make the arms embargo complete, halt investment
and commercial loans and ensure that British measures against apartheid embrace
those already adopted by the US Congress, the Commonwealth and the EEC. We will
support the imposition by the UN Security Council of comprehensive mandatory
economic sanctions and provide help to the Front Line States who bear the brunt
of South African military and economic attack.
We uphold the principle that it is wrong for one country to dominate or threaten
another. We oppose the Soviet presence in Afghanistan. We oppose United States
intervention in Nicaragua and the financing and arming of the Contra terrorists.

Labour will actively seek a stable peace in the Middle East which protects the
security of Israel and recognises the right of Palestinians to
self-determination.
Labour supports genuine guarantees for the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Cyprus and supports the efforts of the United Nations
to achieve that.
We support the human rights movement throughout the world. We champion the
demand for free trade unions in Poland. We will press the Russians to honour
their obligations under international human rights agreements.
International terrorism is a growing menace to liberty and security. Labour is
firmly committed to strengthening national provision and international
co-operation in combating and defeating it.
Labour's aim is to work constructively with our EEC partners to promote economic
expansion and combat unemployment. However, we will stand up for British
interests within the European Community and will seek to put an end to the
abuses and scandals of the Common Agricultural Policy. We shall, like other
member countries, reject EEC interference with our policy for national recovery
and renewal.
DEFENDING OUR COUNTRY
Labour has a proud record of acting in defence of Britain. It was a Labour
government which helped to establish the North Atlantic Alliance. It was a
Labour government which in the 1970s put resources into rebuilding the Royal
Navy and equipping the Royal Air Force with the most up-to-date aircraft.
At the same time, Labour has always linked necessary defence with the need to
reduce hostility between East and West. We must be alert in protecting our
country and equally alert in helping to keep away the scourge of war and nuclear
destruction.
The incoming Labour government will maintain that record of effective defence
whilst working to lower international tension, fear and distrust.
Labour's defence policy is based squarely and firmly on Britain's membership of
NATO. We are determined to make the most useful possible contribution to the
alliance. We can best do that by concentrating our resources on the non-nuclear
needs of our army, navy and air force.
The Polaris system of nuclear delivery is ageing and will soon be obsolete. The
Tories are buying the expensive American Trident system - a policy which
increases nuclear armament without increasing security and, at the same time,
diminishes our effective defences. Trident's cost of up to £10 billion will take
up so much of our defence budget as to deny modern and necessary equipment to
our front line forces. Indeed, this process is already happening.
Labour rejects this dishonest and expensive policy. We say that it is time to
end the nuclear pretence and to ensure a rational conventional defence policy
for Britain.
So Labour will decommission the obsolescent Polaris system. We will cancel
Trident and use the money saved to pay for those improvements for our army, navy
and airforce which are vital for the defence of our country and to fulfil our
role in NATO. We will maintain a 50-frigate and destroyer navy. We will play a
full part in the development of the European Fighter Aircraft. We will invest in
the best up-to-date equipment for the British Army of the Rhine.
That commitment to conventional defence will be based wherever possible on
buying British-made rather than foreign equipment. This policy will provide
greater security for workers in our vital industries like aerospace,
shipbuilding and engineering where jobs are in danger from the reductions which
the Tories are making in conventional defence.
We have always recognised that a properly negotiated and monitored international
agreement to remove nuclear weapons from European soil would provide the most
effective guarantee against the horrors of nuclear war. It would be the most
significant step towards an eventual worldwide renunciation of, and ban upon,
nuclear weapons. That is why we were the first to propose to the superpowers the
zero option in respect of intermediate nuclear weapons.
Labour therefore strongly supports the talks between the United States and
Soviet governments aimed at reducing nuclear armaments. Success in these efforts
to negotiate the removal of all intermediate nuclear missiles in Europe would be
warmly welcomed. It would mean the removal of America's Cruise missiles here in
Britain and in the rest of Europe, as well as Pershing IIs in Germany and the
Soviet SS20s and other shorter-range missiles.
We naturally, therefore, want to assist that process in every way possible. If,
however, it should fail we shall, after consultation, inform the Americans that
we wish them to remove their cruise missiles and other nuclear weapons from
Britain. We would then become the ninth - of the sixteen NATO members - which do
not have US nuclear weapons on their territory. This change would, of course,
not affect the other US, British and joint defence and early warning systems in
the United Kingdom.
We will oppose the extension of the arms race into outer space and will seek an
international agreement to abolish chemical weapons.
THE WAR WE MUST FIGHT
The world is aware, as never before, of the horrors of famine and poverty in
many countries. A Labour Britain will play its full part in defeating these
scourges.
We will set up a Department of Overseas Development and Co-operation, headed by
a Cabinet Minister. We will double Britain's aid budget in order to achieve the
United Nations' target of 0.7 per cent of national income within five years. We
will restore funding for development education. We will give greater support to
voluntary agencies. We will promote international action to lift the burden of
Third World debt and improve the trading conditions of the developing countries.

In all of our policies for making our aid commitment more effective we shall
consult the agencies and the men and women of the communities that use the aid
to help to win their freedom from want and poverty.
BRITAIN WILL WIN WITH LABOUR
On June 11, the people of Britain have the opportunity to put behind them the
bleak years of Thatcherism and to give our country a fresh start Labour's plans,
carefully costed, prudently programmed, can provide that start.
To go on under Toryism is to accept lower expectations and narrower horizons: it
is to surrender to national decline and national division.
We must not shackle ourselves or burden our children with that future of
failure. Together, we can be successful not just in material and economic terms,
though these are vitally important, but also in terms of our sense of purpose,
our freedom, independence and confidence.
That success can come only when the nation is restored to strength and unity in
their fullest sense.
Labour has the policies to generate efficient production and secure high
standards of justice. Labour has the vision and commitment to stimulate the
energies, the skills and the will to succeed of the British people.
In our precious democratic tradition, a general election passes power back from
Parliament to the people. We urge the people to use their power in their own
interests, their families' interests, their country's interests.
Britain will win with Labour.

It's time to get Britain working again


Winter ending
'A cold coming we had of it'
huddled together in cardboard cities,
crouched over shared books in leaking classrooms,
crammed into peeling waiting-rooms,
ice stamped into crazy-paving
round polluted streams.
Winter ending:
paintings, poems bud hesitantly,
tentative chords behind boarded facades;
factories open like daffodils,
trains flex frozen rheumatic joints,
computer-screens blink on
in the sudden daylight.
As the last cardboard boxes
are swept away beneath busy bridges,
the cold blue landscape of winter
suddenly alive with bright red roses.

Foreword by the Rt. Hon. Neil Kinnock
Leader of the Labour Party
This general election is a choice between a Conservative government paralysed by
recession, and a Labour government determined to get on with building recovery.
Gripped by the longest recession since the war, Britain needs a government with
a clear sense of direction and purpose. A government with the people and the
policies to get Britain working again and to achieve sustained recovery -
strength with staying power.
Labour will be such a government.
But this election is not only a choice between policies, important though both
are. It is also a choice between values.
At the core of our convictions is belief in individual liberty.
We therefore believe:
First, that for liberty to have real meaning the standards of community
provision must be high and access to that provision must be wide.
Second, that those rights of the individual must, like all others in a free
society, belong to all men and women of every age, class and ethnic origin and
be balanced by responsibilities of fair contribution and law-abiding conduct.
Third, that for rights and responsibilities to be exercised fully and fairly,
government in Britain as in other industrialised democracies, must work to build
prosperity by properly supporting research, innovation, the improvement of
skills, the infrastructure and long-term industrial development.
Our vision for Britain is founded on these values. Guided by them, we will make
our country more competitive, creative, and just; more secure against crime,
aggression and environmental danger. We want government to serve the whole
nation - using its power to realise this vision.
Labour will be such a government.
These are our convictions and we will work to fulfil them. They are also
down-to-earth aims - essential objectives in a country hit by recession,
suffering run-down public services and facing the intensifying pressures of
European and global economic competition.
Ml of those realities require that the government provides: a stable economic
environment; education and training that fosters the abilities of all young
people and adults; a firm emphasis on productive investment in both the public
and private sectors.
Labour will implement and maintain those policies. They are vital for
prosperity, for consistently low inflation and for continuous improvement in
economic performance and living standards. They are also fundamental to
improving the quality and quantity of provision in health and social services,
and to combating poverty We have absolute commitment to a high-quality National
Health Service, free at time of need and not fractured and weakened by
underfunding and a commercialised contract system. We will get on with
fulfilling that commitment from the moment of our election - by strengthening
and modernising the NHS, by extending care in the community and by establishing
the National Health Initiative to prevent illness.
Our pledges to increase the income of pensioners and families with children will
urgently be fulfilled. Our undertakings to stop the perpetual experiments in
schools and to raise standards of investment and achievement in education will
be kept in full.
These policies - like those to increase house-building, improve transport and
protect the environment - are not only important to the well-being of the
British people now. They are vital preparations for the future. In that future,
we are determined that Britain will be a leader in the New Europe, setting
higher standards and not surrendering influence by opting out. We have
confidence in our country and in the qualities and potential of its people. We
want to nourish their artistic, scientific, sporting and other abilities. And we
want to enhance their democratic power too. We shall therefore make
constitutional and other changes that will give renewed vitality to our
democracy We shall empower people as citizens and as consumers of public and
private services. We
will strengthen equality before the law and equality of opportunity for the
majority of the population -women. Neither their legal status nor their chances
in education, training and employment are full or free. We will ensure that the
barriers to fairness are removed.
These policies, like many others, manifest our practical commitment to freedom.
That purpose is not confined to the shores of our country. In an age where
liberty has made great advances in the world, there is still conflict,
instability and want, causing great misery and inhibiting the peace and
co-operation which we want to help to build. We shall, therefore ensure that our
country has the defence capacity, the strength of alliance and the peace-making
commitment necessary to safeguard the United Kingdom, to participate in
international negotiations for disarmament, to deter aggression and to
contribute to constructing a New World Order, now feasible through the
strengthened United Nations.
In our relations with the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe as well
as with the poverty-stricken peoples of the South, we will work from the
principle that political freedom needs the sure foundation of economic security.
In this increasingly inter-dependent world there are no distant crises. The
Labour government will therefore, as a matter of moral obligation and in the
material interests of our country, foster the development and trade
relationships necessary for the advance of economic security, political
democracy and respect for human rights.
The United Kingdom has been through 13 years in which unemployment has more than
doubled, irreplaceable assets have been wasted, markets at home and abroad have
been lost, manufacturing investment has fallen, poverty has increased, the crime
rate has rocketed, and talents have been neglected.
Now our country faces clear alternatives.
A Conservative government would mean a repeat of the same, stale policies which
brought economic insecurity, privatised and underfunded public services and
increased social division. The Conservatives have no policies which would mean
sustained recovery, higher health care or improved educational standards. The
arrogance remains which brought us the poll tax, centralisation in Britain and
isolation in Europe.
If they can't get it right in 13 years, they never will.
The Labour government will mean a fresh start for Britain. It will mean strong
and continued emphasis on investment for economic strength. It will mean action
to help families, fair taxation, incentives for enterprise and support for
essential community services.
It will mean greater freedom, securitv and opportunity. It will mean change for
the better.
It's time to make that change.
It's time for Labour.



Immediate action for national recovery
Britain faces a huge task of national reconstruction. From day one, the new
government must start to get Britain working again. It must get the economy out
of recession, it must lay foundations for the future. Recovery must be based on
investment, for only investment will create lasting prosperity.
Today. millions of people fear losing their job, their home or their business.
The new Labour government's National Recovery Programme will start to remove
that fear with immediate action on investment. jobs and training. It will combat
recession now and build sustained and sustainable recovery for the future.
Britain's economic problems are deep-seated. We will not be able to do at once
everything that we would like to do. But we will get down to business right
away. And as with any properly-run business. our immediate programme will be
part of a strategy for long-term success.
Action for industry
1 We will provide enhanced capital allowances to encourage companies immediately
to bring forward manufacturing investment in new machinery and plant, innovation
and design. This will last for a limited period.
2. We will introducc an investment tax incentive tailored to the special needs
of small businesses.
3. We will immediately begin the phased release of receipts from the sale of
council houses land and property receipts to allow local authorities to build
new homes and improve old ones. More building workers in the recession-savaged
construction and building supply industries will be employed and more families
rehoused. Equivalent arrangements will be made in Scotland.
4. We will allow British Rail to proceed with a leasing scheme of 188 new
Networker trains on the North Kent line - the first step in securing private
investment to help modernise Britain's railways and protect our environment.
Action for jobs
5. Housing investment will generate jobs. We will also establish a work
programme combining three days a week work for the unemployed - paid at the
proper rate - with two days' training and job seeking. This will benefit the
community and ensure that unemployed people are offered a range of employment
and training opportunities. The programme which can be quickly and easily
established will allow us to start bringing down unemployment immediately. Our
aim is to prevent long-term unemployment rather than just trying to cope with it
after it has occurred
Action for skills and schools
6. We will restore last year's training cuts which caused so much damage to
training for young people and the unemployed. We will establish a new
cash-limited Skills for the 90s fund with an initial budget of £300 million, to
upgrade the training of those in work. Investment will be targeted particularly
at areas of skill shortages and will
give people who are now unskilled the chance to acquire basic skills.
7. Over the next 22 months, additional resources of at least £600 million will
be available for investment in education. Amongst other projects, this will help
to tackle equipment shortages and the backlog of school repairs.
Action for the NHS
Over the next 22 months. additional at least £1 billion will be available for
investment in the National Health Service. This will help the NHS to make real
advances in care and treatment.
Action for children
9. We will start to increase nursery education places for three and four year
olds by making sure that local councils actually use the money they receive for
nursery education to create new places and by switching capital funds
earmarked for the City Technology College programmes. This will lead to the
rapid creation of 25,000 new places.
10. We will extend the exemption from tax which applies to workplace nurseries
to all forms of employer assistance with childcare.
Getting results
Every action we propose makes sense by itself. Together our proposals add up to
a co-ordinated programme for recovery.
By investing in house-building and repairs, we start to rehouse homeless people.
By investing in public transport, we start to transform commuters' lives and
create a cleaner environment.
By investing in the NHS, we offer new security to the patients and the public.
By investing in education we nourish the talents of children and lay the basis
for future success.
With each step we employ more workers in industries from construction and
computer software to high-tech engineering printing and publishing. We enable
businesses to thrive. We save taxpayers' money on benefits. We transform
unemployment claimants into employed contributors.
Labour's programme for national recovery will this year help bring Britain out
of recession. Public investment will modernise services help business and
industry and stimulate private investment. It will make you and your family
better off.
Building a strong economy
Labour's economic policy rests on one simple, commonsense fact. The only way for
Britain to build a strong economy is to make the goods and services which people
at home and abroad want to buy
Britain is in a race for economic survival and success. Faced with intense
competition, companies and countries can succeed only by constantly improving
their performance. Every employee in every enterprise must be involved in a new
partnership so that trained and talented people can use the most modern
technologies to create top-quality products.
But none of this will happen with a government that believes that the best thing
is to do nothing. Three thousand men and women have lost their jobs on every
working day since John Major became Prime Minister. Every week 900 businesses go
bankrupt. Every dav 200 families lose their homes.
The Conservatives have created the longest recession for 60 years. They have no
idea how to get us out of it and even less idea how to stay out of it. Britain
needs a Labour government which will back British industry in the way our
competitors back theirs.
A government which business can do business with
Modern government has a strategic role not to replace the market but to ensure
that the market works properly. Other competitors in Europe and elsewhere
recognise that industrial policy must be at the heart of economic policy. It is
the government's responsibility to create the conditions for enterprise to
thrive.
Business needs sustained and balanced growth, with stable exchange rates, steady
and competitive interest rates and low inflation. We will deliver them.
Business must have a high level of education science and skills. Incentives for
high-tech investment. Modern transport.
Strong regional economies for new developments. We will deliver them.
We will keep prices down
Inflation has been suppressed by recession. But it has not been cured.
To curb inflation. Labour will maintain the value of the pound within the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism. We will manage credit sensibly. We will stop
excessive price rises in water, electricity, telephones, transport and NHS
prescriptions.
The only way to defeat inflation in the medium term is to raise productivity
substantially. By promoting investment and improving skills we will tackle the
underlying causes of inflation.
We will introduce fair taxes
Attacking poverty is an essential component of Labour's programme for national
recovery and prosperity. The most effective way to reduce poverty quickly is to
increase child benefit and pensions and take low-paid people out of taxation. To
achieve these goals, we will reform the national insurance and income tax
system.
We will increase child benefit to £9.95 a week for all children with the full
value going to every family. This measure will benefit seven million families
and is worth £127.40 a year to a family with two children.
We will increase the basic retirement pension by an extra £5 a week for a single
person and £8 for a married couple. All pensioners will receive the full
increase which will also go to widows and others on benefits linked by statute
to the basic pension level. Twelve million people will benefit.
We will abolish the two per cent national insurance contribution on earnings
under £54 a week - effectively a £56 annual entry fee into the national
insurance system.
At present employees earning less than
£405 a week pay contributions on all their earnings, while above that level no
contributions are paid at all. This is an unfair anomaly in our tax structure.
The ceiling on contributions will therefore be abolished.
We will take 740,000 taxpayers out of taxation altogether by increasing the
personal allowance and wife's earned income allowance by more than inflation.
Married couples will have the option of splitting the married couple's allowance
between them as they choose.
The basic rate of tax will remain unchanged at 25 per cent, as will the 40 per
cent rate. A new top rate income tax of 50 per cent will apply to individuals
with an income of at least £40,000 this year.
Labour's tax and benefit changes are self-financing. They are fair. And they
will make every individual employee on earnings up to at least £22,000 a year
better off.
We will reform decision-making
Britain urgently needs a better way of making economic decisions. Government
must decide at the same time how much to spend and how to pay for spending. The
Budget should decide both.
Every autumn, we will make a State of the Nation report on the British economy.
Our national economic assessment will then allow employers, trade unions and
other social partners to consider Britain's competitiveness and the competing
claims on national output. These considerations will be an important influence
on collective bargaining.
In order to provide honest information about the state of the British economy,
we will make the Central Statistical Office independent and free from political
interference.
We will halt the deterioration which has taken place in the pay and conditions
of many public service workers - often through pay settlements which have been
arbitrarily imposed upon them. We will seek fairer and more rational ways of
determining public sector pay within clearly defined budget limits.
We will cut unemployment
We are determined to make a swift reduction in unemployment and have explained
in our NationaI Recovery Programme just how this will be done. It includes
immediate action for unemployed people, as well as direct investment - for
instance, in construction - to create thousands of new jobs.
Steady and sustained economic growth will generate jobs that last. Better
training will help people get back to work.
Unemployment must be tackled by the European Community as a whole. We will use
our influence in Europe to secure the necessary policies for co-ordinated
growth.

We will modernise Britain's industries
It is time to rebuild Britain's industrial strength. For lasting recovery,
Britain needs a modern industrial policy designed to build skills, upgrade
technology, encourage industry in every region and expand exports.
An Investment Decade for Britain will start with the immediate introduction of
enhanced investment allowances (see page 9). We will help Britain's
high-technology industries with a 25% tax credit for additional investment in
research and development. Small firms will be assisted with a new investment
scheme, combining a cash-limited fund for new investments with tax incentives
tailored to heir special needs.
Britain's industrial future depends on transforming our inventive genius into
manufacturing strength. Labour will work with industry to establish British
Technology Enterprise and create Technology Trusts throughout Britain, building
bridges between industries and universities and helping firms turn good ideas
into commercial products. We will encourage the development of the most modern
telecommunications networks.
Labour's Minister for Science will develop a national strategy to promote
high-quality science and technology, so that Britain can better anticipate and
respond to the challenges of the future.
All over the world, industries face unprecedented environmental challenges. We
will support new research into
environmentally-friendly technologies and launch a Great Environment Exhibition
to publicise and to promote sales of the cleanest British technologies.
We will strengthen our regional economies
We will establish new Regional Development Agencies in England, strengthen
Scottish Enterprise and the Welsh Development Agency and modernise regional
incentives. Regional agencies will become powerhouses for industrial
development, encouraging investment, technology and skills. The Scottish
Parliament will have a vital role in building the competitive strength of the
Scottish economy. Our new Welsh Assembly will also have important economic
responsibilities.
Labour's National Investment Bank, operating on strictly commercial lines, will
bring public and private sector together to invest in long-term regional and
national infrastructure projects.
Small and growing businesses will have a new deal. As well as the lowest
possible interest rates, they need the backing on which their competitors can
rely in France and Germany. Labour will establish a network of one-stop advice
centres providing them with access to high-quality specialist assistance.
We will give special attention to the establishment of small businesses by
women, and members of the ethnic minority communities, who often face
difficulties raising venture capital.
Under the Conservatives, Britain has moved from manufacturing trade surplus to
manufacturing trade deficit. The recent privatisation of the Export Credit
Guarantee Department can only do further damage. Labour will create modern
export services for the nation and the regions.
We will invest in modern transport
Commuters and companies need fast, safe transport Labour will act to make sure
they get it. It is absurd that French Railways can raise funds for new
investment in the City of London, when British Rail is not allowed to do so. We
will remove these restrictions. Leasing schemes will allow large-scale
investments to be financed at relatively little
cost to the public sector borrowing requirement.
Private finance will also be mobilised for a high-speed rail network which will
eventually link every region to the Channel Tunnel with proper environmental
safeguards.
We will improve energy supplies
Families, commerce and industry need heat, light and power at prices they, can
afford. Britain is well placed with reserves of coal, oil and gas which must be
husbanded in a national energy policy to balance the needs of the present with
those of the future. We will encourage enhanced recovery of oil from the North
Sea and avoid becoming too dependent in on imported fuel. We will meet our
international obligations to reduce harmful chimney emissions.
We will restore public control of the National Grid and give it new duties and
powers to ensure the long-term security of electricity supplies. We will secure
the long-term future of the coal industry by reducing imports, stopping the
'dash for gas' and reining back on open-casting. We will retain the Department
of Energy and move its petroleum engineering directorate to Aberdeen. We will
require the energy companies to invest in R&D, and encourage the development of
clean-burn coal technology.
We will invest in people at work
The key to a successful modern economy is a well-educated and motivated
workforce. We cannot compete on the basis of low educational standards or poor
working conditions. Britain's future must be high skill, high wage and high
tech.
Two things are needed: a training revolution to modernise people's skills, and
rights for employees to fair treatment at work.
We will offer unemployed people a range of employment and training
opportunities. Our aim is to ensure that anyone who is unemployed for more than
six months has a choice of job experience or training. We will also help the
people often left out of good training opportunities, including the disabled,
women returning after caring for children, and those with special educational
needs.
Expanded childcare will help women return to work and undertake training. A
critical task is to upgrade the skills of people in work. Training and
Enterprise Councils will be retained, reformed and made more broadly
representative of their local communities and given stable budgets.
Instead of the present series of piecemeal initiatives we will establish a
coherent national training policy to meet the needs of industry and provide
people with real equal opportunities at work. All employers, except for very
small businesses, will be obliged to invest a minimum amount on training their
workforce or make a contribution to the local or national training effort.
Training will be a real partnership between government and industry, not an
excuse to shift all the burden onto employers.
We will transform the Careers Service to make careers advice available to
everyone, young or old, employed or unemployed.
Britain cannot get the best performance from our employees by giving them the
worst treatment. There will be a fair framework of law for both employers and
unions. There will be no return to the trade union legislation of the 1970s.
Ballots before strikes and for union elections will stay. There will be no mass
or flying pickets. But our individual employees are entitled to be treated at
least as fairly as their colleagues in Europe.
We will opt in to the Social Chapter of the new European Treaty and introduce
employment standards common in successful economies, including the best health
and safety legislation. The existing protection provided for people engaged in
especially hazardous work will be retained.
Women and men must be able to care for their family as well as earn a living. We
will give all employees equal rights and status under the law, whether they are
full-time or part-time, permanent or temporary. We aim to guarantee every woman
in employment the right to 14 weeks' maternity leave on full pay, and to give
fathers paternity leave, bringing Britain into line with the better provision
elsewhere in the European Community.
Employees will have new rights to be consulted and informed about decisions
which affect them, as well as the right to union membership and representation.
We will restore union rights at GCHQ. Anti-discrimination law will be
strengthened and we will consider as part of that law outlawing discrimination
in employment on the grounds of age.
Britain's Wages Councils set minimum wages for about 2.5 million people. But
there is no minimum wage for all employees. We will end the scandal of poverty
pay and bring Britain into line with the rest of Europe by introducing a
statutory minimum wage of £3.4O an hour. This is a major but long overdue reform
which will benefit around four million low-paid people, 80 per cent of whom are
women. We will consult widely to ensure smooth implementation.
We will promote a stake for employees
Employees should have the opportunity to own collectively a significant stake in
the company for which they work, through a democratic Employee Share Ownership
Plan (ESOP) or a co-operative. We will strengthen support for such schemes and
consult about the possibility of creating a new tax incentive to encourage
companies to establish or extend an ESOP or set up a co-operative.
Recent pension fund scandals have shown how right Labour has been to call for
stronger legal protection. We will reform the law so that pension funds belong
to their members, not to employers. Half of the pension trustees will be
employees, with an independent chairman, and pensioners will be represented.
Modernising the National Health Service
This election will decide the future of the NHS. Indeed, it will decide whether
or not we continue to have a NHS of the kind that the British people want. The
Conservatives would continue to commercialise and privatise the NHS until it is
run as just another business. With Labour, it will be modernised and restored as
a high-quality public service, accountable to the community.
Labour will stop the privatisation of the NHS and return opted-out hospitals and
other services to the local NHS. We will halt the commercial market which is
creating a two-tier health service.
Our commitment to the NHS
For a decade, the Conservatives have persistently underfunded the health
service. It may well take at least the lifetime of a Parliament to put things
right, but Labour will start immediately. Instead of cutting income tax, we will
make additional resources of at least £1 billion available for investment in the
NHS over the next 22 months. Each year thereafter, we will continue to tackle
underfunding. Unlike the Conservatives, we ill not impose any new health
charges.
Labour will recognise the additional claims on the NHS from the growing number
of very elderly people and the development of medical technology and knowledge.
We will retain the pay review bodies. We will not cheat
health authorities by agreeing pay awards which are not fully funded and leaving
managers to bridge the gap by cutting patient care. We will invest in the
modernisation of our hospitals and tackle the backlog of repairs and
maintenance.
We will also launch a new programme to invest £60 million in the modernisation
of Britain's cancer services, using the resources we will save by scrapping the
Conservatives' tax handout on private medical insurance. Within our overall
budget, we will tackle the shortage of intensive care beds with a special
programme providing an additional £25 million to expand this life-saving
service.
A healthy Britain
Labour will launch a National Health Initiative to promote physical and mental
health from birth to old age. This initiative will be led by the Department of
Health and Community Care and by a new Cabinet committee that will cut through
departmental boundaries.
We will set new targets to cut the inequalities in health between social classes
and ethnic groups. Our Health Initiative will set targets for better health,
backed by effective action. We will, for instance:
  strengthen screening by restoring the free eye test;
  cut cancer by banning tobacco advertising;
  encourage healthy diets by introducing clearer food labeling;
  promote health at work by creating a modern occupational health service within
  the NHS.
GPs have a vital role to play in health promotion. We will increase the time
they have for each patient by reversing the financial pressures to take on too
many patients. We will make sure every community has access to dentists, with
the resources to provide full NHS cover we will and restore the free dental
check.
By improving family planning services, we will reduce unwanted pregnancies and
help achieve our target of cutting the number of abortions by at least a
quarter. We will ensure that access to abortion is equally available in every
region.
A modern NHS
We will create a modern, efficient NHS with incentives to improve performance -
but without the queue-jumping and waste created by a market in health care.
We will provide more services through local health centres and other community
settings. We will give GPs the power to insist on improvements in service to all
the patients in a neighbourhood.
We will give the outcome of treatment the same importance as the throughput of
treatment. Our new Health Quality Commission will monitor the quality of care
and raise standards.
The continuing care of very elderly and chronically sick patients will be a
higher priority. We will halt the reduction in NHS services for long-term care
and community health services which support elderly and disabled patients at
home
To achieve this change of direction, we will negotiate Performance Agreements
with each health authority and back them with an Incentive Fund to reward
authorities which perform well. These agreements will set local targets which
reflect local priorities, for instance, to cut waiting lists or switch mental
health services into the community. Hospital to managers, who will be
accountable for meeting their targets, will otherwise be given maximum freedom
of decision making.
We will create new community health authorities, representative of local people,
which bring together both GP services and hospital care.
A first-class service to patients
In Labour's health service, power will belong to patients, not accountants. We
will restore the right of patients to be treated in the hospital of their
choice. Women will have the right to be seen by a woman GP and we will encourage
the development of well women clinics. Ethnic minorities will have the right to
obtain the diet required by their religious
beliefs.
We will set four new standards for a better service to:
  cut cancelled operations;
  improve cleanliness in hospitals;
  make it easier to phone for an ambulance;
  increase early admissions from waiting lists.
As part of our commitment to a quality service to patients, we will end
compulsory competitive tendering for hospital support services, which has driven
down standards of cleanliness and catering.
We will invest £25 million from within our overall budget to purchase several
hundred more new, fully-equipped ambulances.
A community service
Labour will expand the services which elderly people and their carers need for
long-term support in the community, such as home helps, care assistants and
community services. Our Department of Health and Community Care, with a new
Minister of State for Community Care, will develop a high-quality programme of
community care which responds to what users want.
We will introduce a new earmarked grant for community care which will support
the work of Labour councils in providing care for people at home, and oblige
Conservative councils to use the grant to improve those services. We will end
the pressure on councils to privatise their residential homes by providing
funding for local authorities equivalent to the benefits paid to private homes.
We will insist that the first call on income from the sale of mental health
hospitals is the provision of better accommodation and services in the community
for mental health users and people with learning disabilities. We will end the
neglect that has allowed some former patients to end up sleeping rough and led
to others being placed on remand. Labour will ensure that these services are in
place before patients who will benefit from life in the community are
transferred out of long-term hospital care.
Raising standards in our schools
Good education is the best investment in Britain's future. All girls and boys,
from every background, must be able to discover their talents and fulfil their
potential.
We want every child to get qualifications that count. We need safe, disciplined
schools, where professional teachers work closely with parents. Learning must
become a lifetime opportunity, with new chances to update skills at work.
That is our vision of a well-educated Britain.
But, under the Conservatives, Britain today invests a smaller share of our
national wealth in education than in 1979. More and more parents are now being
forced to pay for essentials in a system which should be free.
Labour will modernise Britain's schools. Over the next 22 months, additional
resources of at least £600 million will be made available for investment in
education. We will then continue steadily to increase the share of Britain's
national wealth invested in education.
We will offer nursery education to three and four year olds
By the end of the decade, all three and four year o1ds will have the opportunity
of nursery education if their parents so wish.
Within six months, every local education authority will have to set targets for
steadily increasing nursery and childcare services. Childhood Partnerships
between councils, parents, schools, local businesses and community groups will
help extend a wide range of childcare and nursery education services.
The immediate investment in childcare described earlier (see page 10) is only
the beginning. Our Ministry for Women will have central role in helping to
develop a nationwide childcare strategy, including out-of-school and holiday
provision as well as care for younger children.
We will raise standards in our schools
By investing in better teaching, smaller classes and modern books and equipment
we will raise education standards.
Teachers will be guaranteed a proper salary and career structure. A General
Teaching Council for England and Wales will help them achieve the highest
professional standards. Higher quality training will be followed by proper
support for newly-qualified teachers. A national in-service training programme
will ensure that all teachers are fully qualified in the subject they are
teaching.
Within 12 months, we will end the scandal of primary school classes of over 40
children. We will then establish and steadily reduce maximum limits on class
sizes, until no primary school child is taught in a class of more than 30.
To make sure that children are reading by the age of seven, we will create a
national Reading Standards Programme, with a national Reading Recovery Programme
to help those in difficult. £20 million will be invested in reading recovery in
the first year. National tests must provide the information needed to help
pupils, and to judge schools' effectiveness, without wasting good teaching time.
Children with special needs or special abilities will receive the extra
attention they deserve.
Nine out of ten secondary school children are in comprehensive schools. We will
end selection at 11 where it still exists. We will introduce a fairer system for
all school reorganisations, with independent public enquiries. We will phase out
the Assisted Places scheme (without affecting pupils currently on a place, or
offered one from September 1992) and redirect the savings to meet wider
educational needs.
Because the national curriculum cannot be properly taught without new textbooks,
we will earmark funds for class and library books. Every child needs a good
grounding in science and technology. We will introduce a programme to improve
equipment and laboratories. We will start to tackle the backlog of school
repairs. For instance, we will invest £30 million to ensure that within 12
months, no child has to use an outside lavatory.
Guaranteed standards
Conservative plans to privatise the schools' inspectorate will be scrapped Our
Education Standards Commission, together with her Majesty's Inspectors, will
monitor the performance of every school. If a school is under-performing, the
commission, which will be answerable to Parliament, will have the powers to
ensure that it is brought up to standard.
National Awards, similar to the Queen's Award for Industry, will encourage
excellence in schools. We will reform the Conservatives' scheme for the local
management of schools. All schools will be free to manage their day-to-day
budgets, with local education authorities given a new strategic role. Opted-out
schools will be freed from central government control and brought together with
City Technology Colleges into the mainstream of the local school system.
New rights for parents
We will reform the Conservatives' scheme for the local management of schools All
schools will be free to manage their day-to-day budgets, with local education
authorities given a new strategic role. Opted-out schools will be freed from
central government control and brought together with City Technology Colleges
into the mainstream of the local school system.
Home-school contracts will tell parents exactly what the school undertakes to
deliver and what their responsibilities are. If they are dissatisfied with the
school or education authority, they will be able to call in the Education
Standards Commission and get action taken.
We wish to see the key role of church and other voluntary-aided schools secured
and available equally and on the same criteria to all religions.
We will modernise the curriculum
Labour will modernise the national curriculum and apply it in all schools. From
the age of 14, pupils will study five essential subjects. English, mathematics,
science, a modern language and technology. In schools teaching in Welsh, the
study of Welsh will be included. Every pupil will also be offered a wide range
of academic, technical and other options.
Taking account of the views of parents, enployers, teachers, pupils and the
commendations of the Higginson Report, we will establish a five-subject A level
and bring it together with technical qualifications into our new Advanced
Certificate. Open to art-time and full-time students of any age, it will include
'credits' which can be transferred between different institutions. We will
consult widely about the detailed structure of this new qualification, and
finalise proposals quickly.
Young people must have real opportunities to widen their experience and skills.
Sixteen year olds not in full-time education will be entitled to a new
traineeship lasting for up to two years, with an option of a further two years.
Every young person in employment will be guaranteed the right to Learn While You
Earn.
Labour's education targets
We have set ourselves four education targets. They are the basis for our
strategy and the benchmark against which progress will be judged.
First, a nursery education for all three and four year olds whose parents wish
by the year 2000.
Second, within five years, we want four out of five 16 to 18 year olds to be
able to achieve at least five GCSEs at grades A, B or C, or their equivalent.
Third, by the end of the decade, we want half of Britain's 16 to 19 year olds to
be able to qualify at the new Advanced Certificate levels or the equivalent in
BTEC and other post-16 opportunities for study.
Fourth, within 20 years, we will double the number of students in higher
education, with at least one in three young adults participating by the year
2000.
The student loan scheme deters many bright youngsters from poor families. We
will replace it with a fairer system of student grants and targeted help for
housing and vacation hardship. We will take effective steps to safeguard
standards throughout higher education.
We will stop the Conservatives' adult education cuts and encourage local
authorities to develop adult and community education and access courses,
particularly for mature students. People over 50 who missed earlier
opportunities will be able to apply for a 'Return to Learn' grant towards
further or higher education.
The best future for families and communities
Britain's families deserve the support which families receive in other European
countries. We will create a new sense of community and social cohesion.
We will make families better off
As we explained earlier (see page 12), we will increase child benefit for seven
million families. Higher pensions and related benefits will benefit another 12
million people. We will reform the tax and national insurance system, and take
740,000 low-paid people out of tax. After the first year's extra increases we
will restore the link between increases in the basic pension and prices or
earnings, whichever is higher.
Britain's national insurance system is far more efficient than private
insurance. We will open it up to new groups such as low-paid and part-time
workers.
Labour will end the Conservatives' freeze on benefits for widowed mothers and
other lone parents. We will encourage parents on income support to claim
maintenance by allowing them to keep part of it before benefit is cut.
We will restore nutritional guidelines for
school meals and reverse the cuts in free school meals as soon as possible.
We will reform benefits for people with disabilities and make it easier for
those available for work to take employment. As resources allow, we will improve
and extend invalid care allowance.
Labour will develop a flexible decade of retirement between the ages of 60 and
70, 50 that men and women can choose to retire on a full pension or continue in
work without discrimination.
Our new National Pensions Plan, building on the State Earnings Related Pension
Scheme, will offer people now in work a pension based on their 20 best years'
earnings. Those who are self-employed will also be able to join. Occupational
and personal pension schemes will have to guarantee a minimum pension before
they can contract out, and guarantee equal treatment for men and women.
We will reform means-tested benefits, replace the Social Fund, and restore
benefit rights to 16 and 17 year olds as soon as possible. To relieve anxiety
about funeral costs, we will introduce a funeral payment of £600, available on
request. The costs will in most cases be recovered from the deceased's estate,
although small estates will be disregarded.
We will abolish the poll tax
Labour will abolish the poll tax immediately. We will replace it with our Fair
Rates system, related to people's ability to pay. We reject the Conservatives'
unfair banding and discount system, which would create a property poll tax. We
will modernise the valuation system to ensure that properties are fairly
assessed.
Abolition of the minimum 20 per cent contribution - which will be of particular
help to young people - will be followed by an improved rebate system, with
special help to retired people on low incomes living alone.
Business rates will become a local tax again, with rate rebates for small firms.
People need decent homes
Labour will establish mortgage rescue schemes throughout the country, enabling
home buyers to remain as tenants or part-owners. Mortgage interest tax relief
will continue at the present rate. We will seek new arrangements to enable
first-time buyers to concentrate relief in the early years. Housing log books
and an end to gazumping will also help home buyers. We will also ensure that
home-buyers receive proper advice about the potential cost of their mortgages in
future years.
Councils and housing associations will be allowed to lease or buy empty homes in
order to provide accommodation for homeless people. Homes left empty without
good r reason by any public authority will be e transferred to a better social
landlord.
We will restore housing benefit to people under 18 and provide more refuges for
women escaping domestic violence.
Labour will keep the right to buy. We will increase the number of homes for rent
by establishing a Housing Bank to facilitate the balanced use of councils'
capital receipts and offer investment capital at attractive rates of interest.
Tenants will be offered the option to 'part rent, part buy'. Steps will be taken
to improve sub-standard housing.
Council tenants will be guaranteed real rights over their homes. Councils will
set rents at a reasonable level, reflecting income levels in the different
regions and localities. We will eliminate racial discrimination in housing
allocation and improve safety on estates.
In the private sector there is a need both for homes at market rents and those
where rents are regulated and housing benefit payable. We will consult fully
before introducing reforms and will not legislate retrospectively.
All tenants must be protected against noise, nuisance; harassment and shoddy
service.
Leaseholders will have new rights, either to extend their lease, or collectively
buy the freehold of their property from non-resident freeholders.
We will protect people against crime
Crime in Britain has more than doubled since 1979. Over five million crimes were
recorded last year, but the real total is certainly higher.
Labour will insist that local councils work with the police to improve crime
prevention by
  modernising vulnerable estates;
  improving street lighting;
  demolishing derelict buildings;
  fencing off waste-land.
Planning applications will be examined against crime prevention criteria. The
sale of replica guns will be banned.
Elected police authorities will use the extra resources available for the war
against crime to ensure that more police officers are visible on the beat,
backed up by the modern technology which is essential to crime prevention and
detection.
We will implement the recommendations of he Woolf Report to improve prison
conditions. Prison must offer training for employment, not for crime. We will
promote ion-custodial sentences for non-violent rimes and take steps to
eradicate the discrimination in sentencing policy which particularly affects
women and ethnic minority offenders
People have a right to first-class services
We will develop customer contracts for local services, along the lines pioneered
by Labour authorities. Local communities will help design services to meet their
needs, with voluntary groups playing a key role in delivering services.
Our new Quality Commission, incorporating the work of the Audit Commission, will
ensure councils provide high-quality, value-for-money services, with clear
avenues for complaint and redress. We will not tolerate shoddy service,
inefficiency or waste. Councils will have to carry out an annual survey of
customer satisfaction, published just before local elections.
The contracts of chief officers will be linked to quality targets, with senior
managers quired to sample the service they provide. Compulsory competitive
tendering will be abolished, but the Quality Commission will have the power,
where services have broken own, to insist that they are put out to tender, with
contractors required to meet conditions such as quality thresholds and fair
employment.
Local planning must reflect what people, not developers, want. The
Conservatives' bonfire of planning controls has led to ill-thought out
development, often against the wishes of local people. Labour will give people
more say in drawing up plans for their area and create a new right of appeal for
residents against developments which fly in the face of their local plan.
Beneficial development will be speeded up, damaging development checked and the
green belt safeguarded. We will reverse the present planning presumption in
favour of opencast coal mining and give top priority to local people and their
environment.
Councils must be accountable to local people
We shall introduce annual elections in England and Wales, with one third of
councillors elected each year. Councillors must get proper support, to ensure
that they are drawn from all parts of the community and are not financially
disadvantaged.
Labour will sign the European Charter of Local Self Government and give local
councils a general power of competence, in line with other European countries,
so that councils can develop new and imaginative services.
We will reform the system for allocating grants to local councils and introduce
less centralised rules on capital spending, enabling councils to make prudent
long-term investment.
We will support arts and leisure
Building on the example of many Labour councils which have developed imaginative
arts initiatives, we will make the arts a statutory responsibility for local
authorities. Labour's Ministry for the Arts and Media will encourage Britain's
arts and their associated industries, including broadcasting and the press, to
develop new ideas and attract more
people. Government will commission the best designers, artists and architects,
for instance, to help communities transform run-down city centres.
We will renew the BBC's Charter in a way a which guarantees continuation of
high-quality public service broadcasting - available in all parts of the country
and covering a wide spectrum of programmes. The licence fee remains the best way
of financing the BBC and preserving its independence. A concessionary fee will
be introduced for all pensioners.
As people have more leisure, they also need better facilities for sport. We will
encourage councils to invest in modern, well-staffed sports centres for the
enjoyment of people of all ages and abilities, and give mandatory rate relief to
voluntary sports clubs.
New facilities and better backing for people with outstanding talent will help
put Britain back on the international sporting map. We will review sports
taxation, reform the Sports Councils and make football grounds safe for
spectators. We will stop the wanton sale of school playing fields and ensure
that sport takes its proper place within the curriculum.
We will protect consumers
Our Consumers' Charter will cover all goods and services. It will include:
  tougher health and safety standards;
  compensation for injury from dangerous products;
  comprehensive guarantees;
  a fast, simple remedy if things go wrong.
We will press for similar standards throughout the European Community and
strengthen the work of consumer groups and advice centres so that aspirations
and standards are met.
Every utility will be required to provide a customer contract, with compensation
if standards are not met. Gas and electncity disconnections will be banned
completely where young children or elderly people are concerned. We will
regulate telephone services which demean women and corrupt children.
We will strengthen the regulation of the utilities, enforce standards through
our Consumer Protection Commission, and ensure prices are cut or other action
taken where profits are excessive so that the customer gets a fair deal. We will
establish a Petroleum Products Regulator. Government and Parliament will have a
stronger role to work on the consumer's behalf. We will help consumers have a
voice locally and nationally.
We will create a cleaner, safer environment
The greatest challenge we face is the responsibility to ensure the survival of
the planet.
Economic progress goes hand in hand with environmental responsibility. Labour
will embrace the goal of sustainable development, with environmental
modernisation an integral part of our industrial strategy.
Labour's Prime Minister will go to the Earth Summit in June, with a commitment
to stabilising emissions of CO2 (the main source of global warming) at their
1990 levels by the end of the decade and a recognition that significant cuts
will be needed in the early years of the new century. We will adopt the tightest
possible timetable for eliminating CFCs and other chemicals which deplete the
ozone layer.
Our tough pollution standards, based on the health and safety of children, will
be enforced by an independent Environmental Protection Executive. We will
develop a national waste strategy promoting waste minimisation, re-use and
recycling. Business will be encouraged to have environmental audits. The trade
in toxic waste will be banned.
We will establish a new legal right to a clean environment, ensure environmental
freedom of information, implement European environmental standards such as
Environmental Impact Assessment and promote a European Environmental Charter.
Every government policy will be subjected to environmental appraisal,
co-ordinated by a Cabinet Minister for Environmental Protection. An annual Green
Book assessing the environmental impact of government economic policy will
accompany the traditional financial Red Book.
Improving inner cities
We will reverse the unfair treatment which has meant that the inner cities have
lost out in terms of local government finance, housing investment and support
for employment. Labour will pull together the present unco-ordinated initiatives
into a coherent urban programme which will strengthen local economies, generate
jobs and improve the quality of people's lives.
We will encourage local councils to create enterprise partnerships with
employers, trade unions and the community, which will mobilise the commitment
and the enthusiasm of local people. The composition and terms of reference of
urban development corporations will be changed immediately and they will in due
course be wound up in an orderly way.
At the local level, we will tackle litter and graffiti and start to transform
inner city environments by establishing neighbourhood action areas where local
communities can develop their own plans for regenerating the area.
Clean water, healthy food
We will ensure that our drinking water, beaches and rivers meet the highest
European standards and end the dumping of industrial waste at sea. The provision
of water is so fundamental that it is a priority for return to public control.
In the meantime, we will protect consumers against high prices and poor service
and give greater priority to environmental problems.
Labour's independent Food Standards Agency will ensure high food quality
standards. Our Department of Food and Farming will offer British farmers and
consumers a better deal. Subsidies for production will gradually be replaced
with green premium payments to promote environmentally sound management of the
countryside.
We will invest in decent public transport
We will transform transport policy by ensuring, for the first time, that all
road railway, aviation, shipping and inland waterways projects are judged on the
basis of their environmental, social and economic impact. Within six months we
will review the roads programme and mobilise private capital for large-scale
public transport investment.
All major transport projects will be subject to Environment Impact Assessment
and we will fullly observe the requirements of the European Directive on EIAs.
Road building proposals for sensitive areas such as Oxleas Wood and Twyford Down
must be subject to full environmental assessment.
We reject Conservative plans to privatise British Rail. Instead, we will
modernise, setting clear performance targets to improve the quality of service
and shift more freight from road to rail.
We will tackle the problem of congestion and environmental damage by enabling
local authorities to provide better quality transport. We will end the
deregulation of buses, introduce bus priority measures integrated with new rapid
transit systems within a 'green light' programme designed to encourage people to
transfer to public transport. Proper concessionary fare schemes will be
developed in every area. Traffic management schemes to cut unnecessary car use
and better facilities for cyclists and pedestrians will make town centres safer
and more attractive.
We will reform transport taxation in order to encourage smaller, cleaner cars
and the use of catalytic converters. The subsidy to company cars will be phased
out.
In London and the south-east, congestion costs the economy over £10 billion a
year. We will stop bus deregulation and privatisation of London Transport and
promote efficient public transport.
We will seek to reverse the unacceptable decline in Britain's merchant navy and
encourage the greater use of British-owned and crewed vessels, adding to
Britain's security and reducing the cost to our balance of payments.
All transport services will be required to meet high standards of service and
safety, with effective avenues for complaint and compensation where appropriate.
We will establish a new independent transport safety inspectorate within the
health and safety legislation to improve the safety environment which has led to
the terrible tragedies of recent years. Increased security measures and better
staffing will be particularly welcome to women, elderly and disabled people.
Saving energy
Labour will give top priority to energy saving rather than energy sales. We will
set up an Energy Efficiency Agency and a Renewable Energy Agency. We will
require the gas and electricity companies to invest in insulation and other
energy-saving measures.
We will not invest in new nuclear power stations, continue with those in the
planning process or extend the lives of existing nuclear stations beyond their
safe life span. Britain's dependence on nuclear power will therefore steadily
diminish. We will use the most modern technology to deal with the problems of
decommissioning and nuclear waste.
A beffer life in the country
We will expand affordable housing in rural areas, develop countryside colleges
to meet wider training needs and invest in workshops and small business units.
We will support rural schools and improve public transport. The work of the
Rural Development Commission and the Development Board for Rural Wales will be
boosted.
The ecological richness of our countryside must be protected. We will give
people a new right of access to open country, create new national parks and step
up protection for special sites. We will consult widely on the best way forward
for nature conservation and countryside bodies, including independent boards for
all national parks. We will safeguard Britain's rivers and canals and improve
leisure facilities. Anglers will benefit from and contribute to our plans for
improved river quality.
We will protect animals
We will reduce cruelty to animals within Britain and Europe. We will ban the
testing of beauty aids on animals, outlaw fur farming and ensure better
treatment of farm animals and animals in transit. Our national dog registration
scheme will provide the money for a warden service.
As part of our programme to outlaw cruelty wild mammals, we will allow a free
vote in the House of Commons on a proposal to ban the hunting of live quarry
with hounds and, if it is passed, provide parliamentary time for the necessary
legislation. There will be no new limitations on the country sports of angling
or shooting.
A modern democracy
It is time to modernise Britain's democracy. Central to Labour's purpose in
government is our commitment to radical constitutional reform.
Our Charter of Rights, backed up by a complementary and democratically enforced
bill of rights, will establish in law the specific rights of every citizen.
We will start in our first parliamentary session with a Freedom of Information
Act which will open up government to the people. Exceptions will be tightly
drawn.
We will give power to the nations and regions
We will move immediately to establish an elected Scottish Parliament. It will
have powers to legislate for and administer Scotland's domestic affairs and
modernise Scotland's economy and the ability to represent Scotland within the
United Kingdom and Europe.
Labour's legislation will be firmly based on the proposals agreed in the
Scottish Constitutional Convention. The Parliament will be elected on an
Additional Member System. It will be responsible for local government, health,
housing, education, transport, environmental and other policies within Scotland.
In our first year, we will introduce a new Welsh Language Act. We will
establish, in the lifetime of a full Parliament, an elected Welsh Assembly in
Cardiff with powers and functions which reflect the existing administrative
structure. Local government in Wales will be reformed to create between 25 and
30 'most purpose' authorities.
A regional tier of government in the English regions will take over many powers
now exercised nationally, such as regional economic planning and transport.
These new administrations will later form the basis for elected regional
governments. To simplify local government in England, we will establish 'most
purpose' authorities generally
based on district councils. In some areas, a county-wide authority or the
amalgamation of districts may be more appropriate. We will consult widely before
finalising proposals.
London is now the only European capital without the advantage of its own elected
authority. Labour will give Londoners the right to elect a new Greater London
Authority responsible for making London a better place to live and work.
We will safeguard press freedom
We will remove unjustified restrictions on broadcasting and establish an urgent
enquiry by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the concentration of media
ownership. If the press fail to deal with abuses of individual privacy, we will
implement the Calcutt Report's recommendations for statutory protection.
Individuals must be able to control personal information about themselves. We
will strengthen Britain's Data Protection Act in line with European practice.
The security services will be brought under the scrutiny of a Parliamentary
Select Committee.
We will see that justice is done
There is widespread concern about the miscarriages of justice which have
imprisoned innocent people. As part of our sweeping programme of law reform, we
will establish an additional appeals tribunal, including lay members as well as
lawyers, to examine the most contentious convictions. The Police and Criminal
Evidence Act will be reformed.
Convictions will no longer be possible on uncorroborated confession evidence.
We will improve access to legal aid and, when resources allow, extend it to
tribunal hearings. We will encourage the expansion of voluntary advice centres
and invest in better support for victims. We will appoint from the House of
Commons a Minister for Legal Administration, who will initially be part of the
Lord Chancellor's Department. We will go on to create a Department of Legal
Administration headed by a Minister in the Commons who will be responsible for
all courts and tribunals in England and Wales. Future reform of the distinctive
Scottish legal system will be the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament.
We will work with the legal profession to open up new opportunities to women and
to black and ethnic minority groups, and create an independent judicial
appointments commission. A Sentencing Council will bring some consistency into
what is now often a haphazard process. A Court Inspectorate will improve the
efficiency of our often outdated judicial system.
We will offer everyone a the fair chance
Stronger sex and race discrimination laws will ensure that organisations awarded
government contracts take positive steps to promote equal treatment. We will
introduce a new law dealing with discrimination on grounds of sexuality, repeal
the unjust Clause 28 and allow a free vote in the House of Commons on the age of
consent.
In order to safeguard the rights of people with disabilities, we will appoint a
Minister for the Disabled and extend anti-discrimination laws to cover this
group.
We will establish a Children's Minister within the Home Office to co-ordinate
policies for children across departments. One independent Children's
Commissioner will promote the interests of all children. Protecting children
will be high on the agenda, as will the full implementation of the Children Act
and the UN Convention to promote childrens rights.
Labour's Ministry for Women
Following the successful example of France, Germany and many other countries,
Labour will appoint a Cabinet Minister for Women. She will ensure that women's
voices are heard at the highest level. She will monitor the work of all other
departments and co-ordinate action for equal opportunities across government.
The Ministry will also initiate legislation for women. In particular, we will
introduce a new Sex Equality Act which will combine and strengthen the current
equal pay and sex discrimination laws.
The Ministry for Women will have special responsibility for co-ordinating
childcare policy, improving women's safety and encouraging more women to
participate in public life.
The black and ethnic minority communities
We are determined to ensure that women and men from ethnic minority groups are
full and equal members of the community.
As well as strengthening the race discrimination laws and extending the powers
of the Commission for Racial Equality, we will press for similar laws throughout
the European Community. We will not tolerate the present level of racial
harassment and attacks, and will ensure that more effective protection is given
to vulnerable groups. Contract compliance laws will be the first step towards
guaranteeing the black and Asian British their fair share of jobs.
Fair citizenship law
We will introduce fair immigration and citizenship laws which restore the right
to British citizenship for every child born in Britain. Our laws, which will not
discriminate on grounds of sex or race, will respect the right to family life. A
new Act will guarantee sanctuary to genuine refugees but prevent bogus
applications for asylum.
We are determined to see that equally fair laws apply throughout the European
Community and will oppose any attempt to remove voting rights from Commonwealth
citizens in European elections.
Northern Ireland
Labour will continue the present talks on Northern Ireland. In the long term, we
want to see a united Ireland achieved by consensus and without violence. We
support the commitment in the Anglo-Irish Agreement that 'any change in the
status of Northern reland would only come about with the consent of a majority
in Northern Ireland'. We will work within the agreement to achieve our policy of
unity by consent, and strengthen measures against injustice, discrimination and
deprivation.
We will fight terrorism by every lawful means, repealing the counter-productive
Prevention of Terrorism Act and replacing it with measure which is more
effective and genuinely acceptable in a democratic society.
A modern Parliament
Westminster must become more effective in protecting citizens and holding
government to account. We will therefore improve the procedures and facilities
of the House of Commons, strengthen scrutiny of EC legislation, and end
ministerial misuse of the Royal Prerogative.
We will give shareholders the right to vote upon all political donations made by
public companies, require donations to political parties to be declared in a
public register, require the accounts of political parties to be published and,
as recommended by the Houghton Report, introduce state aid for political
parties.
Further constitutional reforms will include those leading to the replacement of
the House of Lords with a new elected Second Chamber which will have the power
to delay, for the lifetime of a Parliament, change to designated legislation
reducing individual or constitutional rights.
We will continue to encourage a wide and well-informed public debate on the
electoral system. The working party on electoral systems which we established in
opposition under the distinguished chairmanship of Professor Raymond Plant will
continue its work with an extended membership and enhanced authority and report
to the next Labour government.
This general election was called only after months of on-again, off-again
dithering which damaged our economy and weakened our democracy. No government
with a majority should be allowed to put the interests of party above country as
the Conservatives have done. Although an early election will sometimes be
necessary, we will introduce as a general rule a fixed parliamentary term.
Britain in a new world
We need a new government to grasp new opportunities. A Labour government ready
to exploit Britain's unique, interlinking membership of the United Nations
Security Council, NATO, the Commonwealth, the European Community and the G7.
It's a new chance to enhance peace in the world
Labour, which in opposition joined our NATO allies in rejecting the Conservative
government's cold war nostalgia, will in government partner the United States in
negotiating to reduce the world's stocks of nuclear weapons. We shall seek to
involve the four former Soviet nuclear republics, together with France and
China. Until elimination of those stocks is achieved, Labour will retain
Britain's nuclear capability, with the number of warheads no greater than the
present total.
With the increase in major nuclear powers from five to eight, proliferation is a
dangerous reality and may become an even greater threat to peace and stability.
The Tory government contributed to proliferation when it permitted the supply of
nuclear weapons material to Saddam Hussein. The Labour government will work in
the United Nations for a strengthened nuclear non-proliferation treaty, backed
by meaningful sanctions and by a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. We will
in addition work for a global ban on chemical and biological weapons and
stronger controls to prevent proliferation of ballistic missiles. Meanwhile, we
will join Russia in ending nuclear tests.
We will actively support the peace-making role of the UN - for example, in
Cambodia and Somalia - and work for a permanent United Nations peace-keeping
force.
It's a new chance to solve long-running disputes
The Labour government will work in the United Nations and the European Community
to enhance peace prospects in the Middle East. Our aims are security for Israel
and self-determination for the Palestinians. There must be strict control on
arms sales to the region.
Labour will work in the United Nations, the Commonwealth, the European Community
and NATO to help bring about the peaceful reunification of Cyprus, on the
federal basis advocated by the sovereign government of Cyprus. The Labour
government will make itself available to our friends in India and Pakistan to
assist in achieving a negotiated solution to the problem of Kashmir that is
acceptable to all the people of Kashmir - Moslems, Hindus and Buddhists.
We will, as a matter of urgency, discuss with Hong Kong's representatives what
measures may best enhance democracy and confidence during Britain's five
remaining years of responsibility for the colony.
It's a new chance to provide genuine security for Britain
As the party which took Britain into NATO, Labour will base its defence policies
on UK membership of the alliance. We will provide whatever resources are needed
for effective defence for our country, providing the necessary level of forces
with the appropriate equipment and weapons.
Unlike the Tories, we recognise that disarmament negotiations and technological
change can bring about problems for our defence industries. Nearly 100,000 lobs
have already been lost during the past two years and 123,000 more are in danger.
Selling more arms to poor countries is not an acceptable or effective way of
maintaining Britain's defence industries. We will stop sales to countries which
might use them for internal repression or international aggression.
The Labour government will set up a Defence Diversification Agency to assist
workers, communities and companies affected by change. The agency will ensure
that resources made available by reductions in defence spending - reductions
already planned by the Conservative government - are used in the first instance
for rebuilding and
investing in our manufacturing base. From the fruits of this investment can stem
finance for health and the social services.
It's a new chance for a new Europe
The Labour government will promote Britain out of the European second division
into which our country has been relegated by the Tories. Our first chance will
be the United Kingdom's six-months' presidency of the Community, starting on 1
July. We shall use that presidency to end the Tories' opt-out from the Social
Chapter, so that the British
people can benefit from European safeguards. We will also use our presidency to
help ensure that poorer countries are not disadvantaged as a result of the
Single Market.
We shall play an active part in negotiations on Economic and Monetary Union. We
shall fight for Britain's interests, working for Europe-wide policies to fight
unemployment and to enhance regional and structural industrial policy. The
elected finance ministers of the different countries must become the effective
political counterpart to the central bank whose headquarters should be in
Britain.
As part of the evolving role of the regions of Europe, we will establish a
Scottish representative office in Brussels and seek appropriate representation
for the Scottish Parliament in European institutions. We shall seek fundamental
changes in the wasteful Common Agricultural Policy. Savings can help finance
other Community projects.
We shall make the widening of the Community a priority, and shall advocate
speedy admission for Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Cyprus, whose membership applications have been or are about to be
lodged. We shall seek to create conditions in which, at the appropriate time,
the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe can join the Community.
It's a new chance for human rights
Labour will set up a Human Rights Division in the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office, and require all Britain's diplomatic posts abroad to appoint an officer
to monitor human rights. There will be an annual report to Parliament. Decisions
on economic aid and arms sales will be linked to human rights records.
It's a new chance to win friends abroad
Labour will end Tory government meddling in the valuable work of the British
Council. Within carefully controlled costings, Labour will consider new scope
for the BBC World Service, praised by listeners such as Terry Waite and Mikhail
Gorbachev, and for the BBC's World Service Television Service.
It's a new chance to fight world hunger and poverty
Under the Tories, Britain's aid budget has been cut to its lowest ever. The
Labour government will aim to meet the United Nations aid target of 0.7 per cent
of GNP within five years - the lifetime of a full Parliament. Labour will
establish a separate Department of State for International development, whose
Minister will be in the Cabinet.
Tackling poverty will be the top priority of our aid programme. We will make aid
more effective, work more closely with non-governmental agencies, put women at
the heart of our programme and, in co-ordination with other donors, reduce the
share of tied aid. Labour will promote environmentally sustainable development
and encourage new approaches to reduce Third World debt. We will restore funding
for development education in the UK.
We will promote greater and fairer trade for poor countries, to enable their
economies to grow and diversify. UN and European Community action to help the
world's poor must become more effective. Labour will take Britain back into
UNESCO.
The Labour government will work within the G7 and the European Community to win
support for a New Marshall Plan to assist the former communist countries of
Central and Eastern Europe and of the ex-Soviet Union. Instability in those
countries, caused by shortages and discontent, could be as great a threat to
world peace as the armed communism that has now disappeared.
It's a new chance for Britain in the Commonwealth
The Tories have regarded the Commonwealth as a wearisome obligation. Labour
believes that this unique inter-racial and inter-hemispheric organization can
play a central role in fighting racism, hunger and human rights violations. We
shall play an active part in the Commonwealth and join the South Africa
Committee of Foreign Ministers which the Tories have boycotted.
It's a new chance to safeguard the environment
The Tories have been laggardly and reluctant in international moves to protect
our planet's environment. Labour will set the pace in pressing for international
action to safeguard the ozone layer, to combat acid rain, to tackle the problem
of global warming, to face up to the environmental needs of the poorest people
of the world. We will scrap the Tory government's opt-out on European Community
environmental protection measures and deadlines. Labour will adamantly oppose
any attempts to permit commercial exploitation of the virgin continent of
Antarctica.

Labour Party Manifesto, General Election 1997new Labour because Britain deserves
better
Britain will be better with new Labour
  'Our case is simple: that Britain can and must be better'
  'The vision is one of national renewal, a country with drive, purpose and
  energy'
  'In each area of policy a new and distinctive approach has been mapped out,
  one that differs from the old left and the Conservative right. This is why new
  Labour is new'
  'New Labour is a party of ideas and ideals but not of outdated ideology. What
  counts is what works. The objectives are radical. The means will be modern'
  ' This is our contract with the people'
I believe in Britain. It is a great country with a great history. The British
people are a great people. But I believe Britain can and must be better: better
schools, better hospitals, better ways of tackling crime, of building a modern
welfare state, of equipping ourselves for a new world economy.
I want a Britain that is one nation, with shared values and purpose, where merit
comes before privilege, run for the many not the few, strong and sure of itself
at home and abroad.
I want a Britain that does not shuffle into the new millennium afraid of the
future, but strides into it with confidence.
I want to renew our country's faith in the ability of its government and
politics to deliver this new Britain. I want to do it by making a limited set of
important promises and achieving them. This is the purpose of the bond of trust
I set out at the end of this introduction, in which ten specific commitments are
put before you. Hold us to them. They are our covenant with you.
I want to renew faith in politics by being honest about the last 18 years. Some
things the Conservatives got right. We will not change them. It is where they
got things wrong that we will make change. We have no intention or desire to
replace one set of dogmas by another.
I want to renew faith in politics through a government that will govern in the
interest of the many, the broad majority of people who work hard, play by the
rules, pay their dues and feel let down by a political system that gives the
breaks to the few, to an elite at the top increasingly out of touch with the
rest of us.
And I want, above all, to govern in a way that brings our country together, that
unites our nation in facing the tough and dangerous challenges of the new
economy and changed society in which we must live. I want a Britain which we all
feel part of, in whose future we all have a stake, in which what I want for my
own children I want for yours.
A new politics
The reason for having created new Labour is to meet the challenges of a
different world. The millennium symbolises a new era opening up for Britain. I
am confident about our future prosperity, even optimistic, if we have the
courage to change and use it to build a better Britain.
To accomplish this means more than just a change of government. Our aim is no
less than to set British political life on a new course for the future.
People are cynical about politics and distrustful of political promises. That is
hardly surprising. There have been few more gross breaches of faith than when
the Conservatives under Mr Major promised, before the election of 1992, that
they would not raise taxes, but would cut them every year; and then went on to
raise them by the largest amount in peacetime history starting in the first
Budget after the election. The Exchange Rate Mechanism as the cornerstone of
economic policy, Europe, health, crime, schools, sleaze - the broken promises
are strewn across the country's memory.
The Conservatives' broken promises taint all politics. That is why we have made
it our guiding rule not to promise what we cannot deliver; and to deliver what
we promise. What follows is not the politics of a 100 days that dazzles for a
time, then fizzles out. It is not the politics of a revolution, but of a fresh
start, the patient rebuilding and renewing of this country - renewal that can
take root and build over time.
That is one way in which politics in Britain will gain a new lease of life. But
there is another. We aim to put behind us the bitter political struggles of left
and right that have torn our country apart for too many decades. Many of these
conflicts have no relevance whatsoever to the modern world - public versus
private, bosses versus workers, middle class versus working class. It is time
for this country to move on and move forward. We are proud of our history, proud
of what we have achieved - but we must learn from our history, not be chained to
it.
New Labour
The purpose of new Labour is to give Britain a different political choice: the
choice between a failed Conservative government, exhausted and divided in
everything other than its desire to cling on to power, and a new and revitalised
Labour Party that has been resolute in transforming itself into a party of the
future. We have rewritten our constitution, the new Clause IV, to put a
commitment to enterprise alongside the commitment to justice. We have changed
the way we make policy, and put our relations with the trade unions on a modern
footing where they accept they can get fairness but no favours from a Labour
government. Our MPs are all now selected by ordinary party members, not small
committees or pressure groups. The membership itself has doubled, to over
400,000, with half the members having joined since the last election.
We submitted our draft manifesto, new Labour new life for Britain, to a ballot
of all our members, 95 per cent of whom gave it their express endorsement.
We are a national party, supported today by people from all walks of life, from
the successful businessman or woman to the pensioner on a council estate. Young
people have flooded in to join us in what is the fastest growing youth section
of any political party in the western world.
The vision
We are a broad-based movement for progress and justice. New Labour is the
political arm of none other than the British people as a whole. Our values are
the same: the equal worth of all, with no one cast aside; fairness and justice
within strong communities.
But we have liberated these values from outdated dogma or doctrine, and we have
applied these values to the modern world.
I want a country in which people get on, do well, make a success of their lives.
I have no time for the politics of envy. We need more successful entrepreneurs,
not fewer of them. But these life-chances should be for all the people. And I
want a society in which ambition and compassion are seen as partners not
opposites - where we value public service as well as material wealth.
New Labour believes in a society where we do not simply pursue our own
individual aims but where we hold many aims in common and work together to
achieve them. How we build the industry and employment opportunities of the
future; how we tackle the division and inequality in our society; how we care
for and enhance our environment and quality of life; how we develop modern
education and health services; how we create communities that are safe, where
mutual respect and tolerance are the order of the day. These are things we must
achieve together as a country.
The vision is one of national renewal, a country with drive, purpose and energy.
A Britain equipped to prosper in a global economy of technological change; with
a modern welfare state; its politics more accountable; and confident of its
place in the world.
Programme: a new centre and centre-left politics
In each area of policy a new and distinctive approach has been mapped out, one
that differs both from the solutions of the old left and those of the
Conservative right. This is why new Labour is new. We believe in the strength of
our values, but we recognise also that the policies of 1997 cannot be those of
1947 or 1967. More detailed policy has been produced by us than by any
opposition in history. Our direction and destination are clear.
The old left would have sought state control of industry. The Conservative right
is content to leave all to the market. We reject both approaches. Government and
industry must work together to achieve key objectives aimed at enhancing the
dynamism of the market, not undermining it.
In industrial relations, we make it clear that there will be no return to flying
pickets, secondary action, strikes with no ballots or the trade union law of the
1970s. There will instead be basic minimum rights for the individual at the
workplace, where our aim is partnership not conflict between employers and
employees.
In economic management, we accept the global economy as a reality and reject the
isolationism and 'go-it-alone' policies of the extremes of right or left.
In education, we reject both the idea of a return to the 11-plus and the
monolithic comprehensive schools that take no account of children's differing
abilities. Instead we favour all-in schooling which identifies the distinct
abilities of individual pupils and organises them in classes to maximise their
progress in individual subjects. In this way we modernise the comprehensive
principle, learning from the experience of its 30 years of application.
In health policy, we will safeguard the basic principles of the NHS, which we
founded, but will not return to the top-down management of the 1970s. So we will
keep the planning and provision of healthcare separate, but put planning on a
longer-term, decentralised and more co-operative basis. The key is to root out
unnecessary administrative cost, and to spend money on the right things -
frontline care.
On crime, we believe in personal responsibility and in punishing crime, but also
tackling its underlying causes - so, tough on crime, tough on the causes of
crime, different from the Labour approach of the past and the Tory policy of
today.
Over-centralisation of government and lack of accountability was a problem in
governments of both left and right. Labour is committed to the democratic
renewal of our country through decentralisation and the elimination of excessive
government secrecy.
In addition, we will face up to the new issues that confront us. We will be the
party of welfare reform. In consultation and partnership with the people, we
will design a modern welfare state based on rights and duties going together,
fit for the modern world.
We will stand up for Britain's interests in Europe after the shambles of the
last six years, but, more than that, we will lead a campaign for reform in
Europe. Europe isn't working in the way this country and Europe need. But to
lead means to be involved, to be constructive, to be capable of getting our own
way.
We will put concern for the environment at the heart of policy-making, so that
it is not an add-on extra, but informs the whole of government, from housing and
energy policy through to global warming and international agreements.
We will search out at every turn new ways and new ideas to tackle the new
issues: how to encourage more flexible working hours and practices to suit
employees and employers alike; how to harness the huge potential of the new
information technology; how to simplify the processes of the government machine;
how to put public and private sector together in partnership to give us the
infrastructure and transport system we need.
We will be a radical government. But the definition of radicalism will not be
that of doctrine, whether of left or right, but of achievement. New Labour is a
party of ideas and ideals but not of outdated ideology. What counts is what
works. The objectives are radical. The means will be modern.
So the party is transformed. The vision is clear. And from that vision stems a
modern programme of change and renewal for Britain. We understand that after 18
years of one-party rule, people want change, believe that it is necessary for
the country and for democracy, but require faith to make the change.
We therefore set out in the manifesto that follows ten commitments, commitments
that form our bond of trust with the people. They are specific. They are real.
Judge us on them. Have trust in us and we will repay that trust.
Our mission in politics is to rebuild this bond of trust between government and
the people. That is the only way democracy can flourish. I pledge to Britain a
government which shares their hopes, which understands their fears, and which
will work as partners with and for all our people, not just the privileged few.
This is our contract with the people.
Over the five years of a Labour government:
1 Education will be our number one priority, and we will increase the share of
national income spent on education as we decrease it on the bills of economic
and social failure
2 There will be no increase in the basic or top rates of income tax
3 We will provide stable economic growth with low inflation, and promote dynamic
and competitive business and industry at home and abroad
4 We will get 250,000 young unemployed off benefit and into work
5 We will rebuild the NHS, reducing spending on administration and increasing
spending on patient care
6 We will be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime, and halve the time
it takes persistent juvenile offenders to come to court
7 We will help build strong families and strong communities, and lay the
foundations of a modern welfare state in pensions and community care
8 We will safeguard our environment, and develop an integrated transport policy
to fight congestion and pollution
9 We will clean up politics, decentralise political power throughout the United
Kingdom and put the funding of political parties on a proper and accountable
basis
10 We will give Britain the leadership in Europe which Britain and Europe need
We have modernised the Labour Party and we will modernise Britain. This means
knowing where we want to go; being clear-headed about the country's future;
telling the truth; making tough choices; insisting that all parts of the public
sector live within their means; taking on vested interests that hold people
back; standing up to unreasonable demands from any quarter; and being prepared
to give a moral lead where government has responsibilities it should not avoid.
Britain does deserve better. And new Labour will be better for Britain.

We will make education our number one priority
  Cut class sizes to 30 or under for 5, 6 and 7 year-olds
  Nursery places for all four year-olds
  Attack low standards in schools
  Access to computer technology
  Lifelong learning through a new University for Industry
  More spending on education as the cost of unemployment falls
Education has been the Tories' biggest failure. It is Labour's number one
priority.
It is not just good for the individual. It is an economic necessity for the
nation. We will compete successfully on the basis of quality or not at all. And
quality comes from developing the potential of all our people. It is the people
who are our greatest natural asset. We will ensure they can fulfil their
potential.
Nearly half of 11 year-olds in England and Wales fail to reach expected
standards in English and maths. Britain has a smaller share of 17 and 18
year-olds in full-time education than any major industrial nation. Nearly two
thirds of the British workforce lack vocational qualifications.
There are excellent schools in Britain's state education system. But far too
many children are denied the opportunity to succeed. Our task is to raise the
standards of every school.
We will put behind us the old arguments that have bedevilled education in this
country. We reject the Tories' obsession with school structures: all parents
should be offered real choice through good quality schools, each with its own
strengths and individual ethos. There should be no return to the 11-plus. It
divides children into successes and failures at far too early an age.
We must modernise comprehensive schools. Children are not all of the same
ability, nor do they learn at the same speed. That means 'setting' children in
classes to maximise progress, for the benefit of high-fliers and slower learners
alike. The focus must be on levelling up, not levelling down.
With Labour, the Department for Education and Employment will become a leading
office of state. It will give a strong and consistent lead to help raise
standards in every school. Standards, more than structures, are the key to
success. Labour will never put dogma before children's education. Our approach
will be to intervene where there are problems, not where schools are succeeding.
Labour will never force the abolition of good schools whether in the private or
state sector. Any changes in the admissions policies of grammar schools will be
decided by local parents. Church schools will retain their distinctive religious
ethos.
We wish to build bridges wherever we can across education divides. The
educational apartheid created by the public/private divide diminishes the whole
education system.
Zero tolerance of underperformance
Every school has the capacity to succeed. All Local Education Authorities (LEAs)
must demonstrate that every school is improving. For those failing schools
unable to improve, ministers will order a 'fresh start' - close the school and
start afresh on the same site. Where good schools and bad schools coexist side
by side we will authorise LEAs to allow one school to take over the other to set
the underperforming school on a new path.
Quality nursery education guaranteed for all four year-olds
Nursery vouchers have been proven not to work. They are costly and do not
generate more quality nursery places. We will use the money saved by scrapping
nursery vouchers to guarantee places for four year-olds. We will invite selected
local authorities to pilot early excellence centres combining education and care
for the under-fives. We will set targets for universal provision for three
year-olds whose parents want it.
New focus on standards in primary schools
Primary schools are the key to mastering the basics and developing in every
child an eagerness to learn.
Every school needs baseline assessment of pupils when they enter the school, and
a year-on-year target for improvement.
We will reduce class sizes for five, six and seven year-olds to 30 or under, by
phasing out the assisted places scheme, the cost of which is set to rise to £180
million per year.
We must recognise the three 'r's for what they are - building blocks of all
learning that must be taught better. We will achieve this by improving the
skills of the teaching force; ensuring a stronger focus on literacy in the
curriculum; and piloting literacy summer schools to meet our new target that
within a decade every child leaves primary school with a reading age of at least
11 (barely half do today).
Our numeracy taskforce will develop equally ambitious targets. We will encourage
the use of the most effective teaching methods, including phonics for reading
and whole class interactive teaching for maths.
Attacking educational disadvantage
No matter where a school is, Labour will not tolerate under-achievement.
Public/private partnerships will improve the condition of school buildings.
There will be education action zones to attack low standards by recruiting the
best teachers and head teachers to under-achieving schools; by supporting
voluntary mentoring schemes to provide one-to-one support for disadvantaged
pupils; and by creating new opportunities for children, after the age of 14, to
enhance their studies by acquiring knowledge and experience within industry and
commerce.
To attack under-achievement in urban areas, we have developed a new scheme with
the Premier League. In partnerships between central government, local government
and football clubs, study support centres will be set up at Premier League
grounds for the benefit of local children. The scheme will be launched on a
pilot basis during the 1997/8 season.
We support the greatest possible integration into mainstream education of pupils
with special educational needs, while recognising that specialist facilities are
essential to meet particular needs.
Realising the potential of new technology
Labour is the pioneer of new thinking. We have agreed with British Telecom and
the cable companies that they will wire up schools, libraries, colleges and
hospitals to the information superhighway free of charge. We have also secured
agreement to make access charges as low as possible.
For the Internet we plan a National Grid for Learning, franchised as a
public/private partnership, which will bring to teachers up-to-date materials to
enhance their skills, and to children high-quality educational materials. We
will use lottery money to improve the skills of existing teachers in information
technology.
In opposition, Labour set up the independent Stevenson Commission to promote
access for children to new technology. Its recent report is a challenging
programme for the future. We are urgently examining how to implement its plans,
in particular the development of educational software through a grading system
which will provide schools with guarantees of product quality; and the provision
for every child of an individual email address. An independent standing
committee will continue to advise us on the implementation of our plans in
government.
The role of parents
We will increase the powers and responsibilities of parents.
There will be more parent governors and, for the first time, parent
representatives on LEAs.
A major objective is to promote a culture of responsibility for learning within
the family, through contracts between all schools and parents, defining the
responsibilities of each. National guidelines will establish minimum periods for
homework for primary and secondary school pupils.
Teachers will be entitled to positive support from parents to promote good
attendance and sound discipline. Schools suffer from unruly and disruptive
pupils. Exclusion or suspension may sometimes be necessary. We will, however,
pilot new pupil referral units so that schools are protected but these pupils
are not lost to education or the country.
New job description for LEAs
The judge and jury of LEA performance will be their contribution to raising
standards.
LEAs are closer to schools than central government, and have the authority of
being locally elected. But they will be required to devolve power, and more of
their budgets, to heads and governors. LEA performance will be inspected by
Ofsted and the Audit Commission. Where authorities are deemed to be failing, the
secretary of state may suspend the relevant powers of the LEA and send in an
improvement team.
Grant maintained schools
Schools that are now grant maintained will prosper with Labour's proposals, as
will every school.
Tory claims that Labour will close these schools are false. The system of
funding will not discriminate unfairly either between schools or between pupils.
LEAs will be represented on governing bodies, but will not control them. We
support guidelines for open and fair admissions, along the lines of those
introduced in 1993; but we will also provide a right of appeal to an independent
panel in disputed cases.
Teachers: pressure and support
Schools are critically dependent on the quality of all staff. The majority of
teachers are skilful and dedicated, but some fall short. We will improve teacher
training, and ensure that all teachers have an induction year when they first
qualify, to ensure their suitability for teaching.
There will be a general teaching council to speak for and raise standards in the
profession. We will create a new grade of teachers to recognise the best. There
will, however, be speedy, but fair, procedures to remove teachers who cannot do
the job.
The strength of a school is critically dependent on the quality of its head. We
will establish mandatory qualifications for the post. A head teacher will be
appointed to a position only when fully trained to accept the responsibility.
Higher education
The improvement and expansion needed cannot be funded out of general taxation.
Our proposals for funding have been made to the Dearing Committee, in line with
successful policies abroad.
The costs of student maintenance should be repaid by graduates on an
income-related basis, from the career success to which higher education has
contributed. The current system is badly administered and payback periods are
too short. We will provide efficient administration, with fairness ensured by
longer payback periods where required.
Lifelong learning
We must learn throughout life, to retain employment through new and improved
skills. We will promote adult learning both at work and in the critical sector
of further education.
In schools and colleges, we support broader A-levels and upgraded vocational
qualifications, underpinned by rigorous standards and key skills.
Employers have the primary responsibility for training their workforces in
job-related skills. But individuals should be given the power to invest in
training. We will invest public money for training in Individual Learning
Accounts which individuals - for example women returning to the labour force -
can then use to gain the skills they want. We will kickstart the programme for
up to a million people, using £150 million of TEC money which could be better
used and which would provide a contribution of £150, alongside individuals
making small investments of their own. Employers will be encouraged to make
voluntary contributions to these funds. We will also promote the extension of
the Investors in People initiative into many more small firms.
Our new University for Industry, collaborating with the Open University, will
bring new opportunities to adults seeking to develop their potential. This will
bring government, industry and education together to create a new resource whose
remit will be to use new technology to enhance skills and education. The
University for Industry will be a public/private partnership, commissioning
software and developing the links to extend lifelong learning.
Government spending on education
The Conservatives have cut government spending on education as a share of
national income by the equivalent of more than £3 billion as spending on the
bills of economic and social failure has risen. We are committed to reversing
this trend of spending. Over the course of a five-year Parliament, as we cut the
costs of economic and social failure we will raise the proportion of national
income spent on education.
We will promote personal prosperity for all
  Economic stability to promote investment
  Tough inflation target, mortgage rates as low as possible
  Stick for two years within existing spending limits
  Five-year pledge: no increase in income tax rates
  Long-term objective of ten pence starting rate of income tax
  Early Budget to get people off welfare and into work
The Conservatives have in 18 years created the two longest, deepest recessions
this century.
We have experienced the slowest average growth rate of any similar period since
the second world war. There has been a fundamental failure to tackle the
underlying causes of inflation, of low growth and of unemployment. These are:
  too much economic instability, with wild swings from boom to bust
  too little investment in education and skills, and in the application of new
  technologies
  too few opportunities to find jobs, start new businesses or become
  self-employed
  too narrow an industrial base and too little sense of common purpose in the
  workplace or across the nation.
Britain can do better. We must build on the British qualities of inventiveness,
creativity and adaptability. New Labour's objective is to improve living
standards for the many, not just the few. Business can and must succeed in
raising productivity. This requires a combination of a skilled and educated
workforce with investment in the latest technological innovations, as the route
to higher wages and employment.
An explicit objective of a Labour government will be to raise the trend rate of
growth by strengthening our wealth-creating base. We will nurture investment in
industry, skills, infrastructure and new technologies. And we will attack
long-term unemployment, especially among young people. Our goal will be
educational and employment opportunities for all.
Economic stability is the essential platform for sustained growth. In a global
economy the route to growth is stability not inflation. The priority must be
stable, low-inflation conditions for long-term growth. The root causes of
inflation and low growth are the same - an economic and industrial base that
remains weak. Government cannot solve all economic problems or end the economic
cycle. But by spending wisely and taxing fairly, government can help tackle the
problems. Our goals are low inflation, rising living standards and high and
stable levels of employment.
Spending and tax: new Labour's approach
The myth that the solution to every problem is increased spending has been
comprehensively dispelled under the Conservatives. Spending has risen. But more
spending has brought neither greater fairness nor less poverty. Quite the
reverse - our society is more divided than it has been for generations. The
level of public spending is no longer the best measure of the effectiveness of
government action in the public interest. It is what money is actually spent on
that counts more than how much money is spent.
The national debt has doubled under John Major. The public finances remain weak.
A new Labour government will give immediate high priority to seeing how public
money can be better used.
New Labour will be wise spenders, not big spenders. We will work in partnership
with the private sector to achieve our goals. We will ask about public spending
the first question that a manager in any company would ask - can existing
resources be used more effectively to meet our priorities? And because
efficiency and value for money are central, ministers will be required to save
before they spend.
Save to invest is our approach, not tax and spend.
The increase in taxes under the Conservatives is the most dramatic evidence of
economic failure. Since 1992 the typical family has paid more than £2,000 in
extra taxes - the biggest tax hike in peacetime history, breaking every promise
made by John Major at the last election. The tragedy is that those hardest hit
are least able to pay. That is why we strongly opposed the imposition of VAT on
fuel: it was Labour that stopped the government from increasing VAT on fuel to
17. 5 per cent.
Taxation is not neutral in the way it raises revenue. How and what governments
tax sends clear signals about the economic activities they believe should be
encouraged or discouraged, and the values they wish to entrench in society. Just
as, for example, work should be encouraged through the tax system, environmental
pollution should be discouraged.
New Labour will establish a new trust on tax with the British people. The
promises we make we will keep. The principles that will underpin our tax policy
are clear:
  to encourage employment opportunities and work incentives for all
  to promote savings and investment
  and to be fair and be seen to be fair.
New Labour is not about high taxes on ordinary families. It is about social
justice and a fair deal.
New Labour therefore makes the following economic pledges.
Fair taxes
There will be no return to the penal tax rates that existed under both Labour
and Conservative governments in the 1970s.
To encourage work and reward effort, we are pledged not to raise the basic or
top rates of income tax throughout the next Parliament.
Our long-term objective is a lower starting rate of income tax of ten pence in
the pound. Reducing the high marginal rates at the bottom end of the earning
scale - often 70 or 80 per cent - is not only fair but desirable to encourage
employment.
This goal will benefit the many, not the few. It is in sharp contrast to the
Tory goal of abolishing capital gains and inheritance tax, at least half the
benefit of which will go to the richest 5,000 families in the country.
We will cut VAT on fuel to five per cent, the lowest level allowed.
We renew our pledge not to extend VAT to food, children's clothes, books and
newspapers and public transport fares.
We will also examine the interaction of the tax and benefits systems so that
they can be streamlined and modernised, so as to fulfil our objectives of
promoting work incentives, reducing poverty and welfare dependency, and
strengthening community and family life.
No risks with inflation
We will match the current target for low and stable inflation of 2. 5 per cent
or less. We will reform the Bank of England to ensure that decision-making on
monetary policy is more effective, open, accountable and free from short-term
political manipulation.
Strict rules for government borrowing
We will enforce the 'golden rule' of public spending - over the economic cycle,
we will only borrow to invest and not to fund current expenditure.
We will ensure that - over the economic cycle - public debt as a proportion of
national income is at a stable and prudent level.
Stick to planned public spending allocations for the first two years of office
Our decisions have not been taken lightly. They are a recognition of
Conservative mismanagement of the public finances. For the next two years Labour
will work within the departmental ceilings for spending already announced. We
will resist unreasonable demands on the public purse, including any unreasonable
public sector pay demands.
Switch spending from economic failure to investment
We will conduct a central spending review and departmental reviews to assess how
to use resources better, while rooting out waste and inefficiency in public
spending.
Labour priorities in public spending are different from Tory priorities.
Tax reform to promote saving and investment
We will introduce a new individual savings account and extend the principle of
TESSAs and PEPs to promote long-term saving. We will review the corporate and
capital gains tax regimes to see how the tax system can promote greater
long-term investment.
Labour's welfare-to-work Budget
We will introduce a Budget within two months after the election to begin the
task of equipping the British economy and reforming the welfare state to get
young people and the long-term unemployed back to work. This welfare-to-work
programme will be funded by a windfall levy on the excess profits of the
privatised utilities, introduced in this Budget after we have consulted the
regulators.
We will help create successful and profitable businesses
  Backing business: skills, infrastructure, new markets
  Gains for consumers with tough competition law
  New measures to help small businesses
  National minimum wage to tackle low pay
  Boost local economic growth with Regional Development Agencies
  A strong and effective voice in Europe
New Labour offers business a new deal for the future. We will leave intact the
main changes of the 1980s in industrial relations and enterprise. We see healthy
profits as an essential motor of a dynamic market economy, and believe they
depend on quality products, innovative entrepreneurs and skilled employees. We
will build a new partnership with business to improve the competitiveness of
British industry for the 21st century, leading to faster growth.
Many of the fundamentals of the British economy are still weak. Low pay and low
skills go together: insecurity is the consequence of economic instability; the
absence of quality jobs is a product of the weakness of our industrial base; we
suffer from both high unemployment and skills shortages. There is no future for
Britain as a low wage economy: we cannot compete on wages with countries paying
a tenth or a hundredth of British wages.
We need to win on higher quality, skill, innovation and reliability. With
Labour, British and inward investors will find this country an attractive and
profitable place to do business.
New Labour believes in a flexible labour market that serves employers and
employees alike. But flexibility alone is not enough. We need 'flexibility
plus':
  plus higher skills and higher standards in our schools and colleges
  plus policies to ensure economic stability
  plus partnership with business to raise investment in infrastructure, science
  and research and to back small firms
  plus new leadership from Britain to reform Europe, in place of the current
  policy of drift and disengagement from our largest market
  plus guaranteeing Britain's membership of the single market - indeed opening
  up further markets inside and outside the EU - helping make Britain an
  attractive place to do business
  plus minimum standards of fair treatment, including a national minimum wage
  plus an imaginative welfare-to-work programme to put the long-term unemployed
  back to work and to cut social security costs.
A reformed and tougher competition law
Competitiveness abroad must begin with competition at home. Effective
competition can bring value and quality to consumers. As an early priority we
will reform Britain's competition law. We will adopt a tough 'prohibitive'
approach to deter anti-competitive practices and abuses of market power.
In the utility industries we will promote competition wherever possible. Where
competition is not an effective discipline, for example in the water industry
which has a poor environmental record and has in most cases been a tax-free
zone, we will pursue tough, efficient regulation in the interests of customers,
and, in the case of water, in the interests of the environment as well. We
recognise the need for open and predictable regulation which is fair both to
consumers and to shareholders and at the same time provides incentives for
managers to innovate and improve efficiency.
Reinvigorate the Private Finance Initiative
Britain's infrastructure is dangerously run down: parts of our road and rail
network are seriously neglected, and all too often our urban environment has
been allowed to deteriorate.
Labour pioneered the idea of public/private partnerships. It is Labour local
authorities which have done most to create these partnerships at local level.
A Labour government will overcome the problems that have plagued the PFI at a
national level. We will set priorities between projects, saving time and
expense; we will seek a realistic allocation of risk between the partners to a
project; and we will ensure that best practice is spread throughout government.
We will aim to simplify and speed up the planning process for major
infrastructure projects of vital national interest.
We will ensure that self-financing commercial organisations within the public
sector - the Post Office is a prime example - are given greater commercial
freedom to make the most of new opportunities.
Backing small business
The number of small employers has declined by half a million since 1990. Support
for small businesses will have a major role in our plans for economic growth. We
will cut unnecessary red tape; provide for statutory interest on late payment of
debts; improve support for high-tech start-ups; improve the quality and
relevance of advice and training through a reformed Business Links network and
the University for Industry; and assist firms to enter overseas markets more
effectively.
Local economic growth
Prosperity needs to be built from the bottom up. We will establish one-stop
regional development agencies to co-ordinate regional economic development, help
small business and encourage inward investment. Many regions are already taking
informal steps to this end and they will be supported.
Strengthen our capability in science, technology and design
The UK must be positively committed to the global pursuit of new knowledge, with
a strong science base in our universities and centres of excellence leading the
world. The Dearing Committee represents a significant opportunity to promote
high-quality standards in science teaching and research throughout UK higher
education. We support a collaborative approach between researchers and business,
spreading the use of new technology and good design, and exploiting our own
inventions to boost business in the UK.
Promoting new green technologies and businesses
There is huge potential to develop Britain's environmental technology industries
to create jobs, win exports and protect the environment.
Effective environmental management is an increasingly important component of
modern business practice. We support a major push to promote energy conservation
- particularly by the promotion of home energy efficiency schemes, linked to our
environment taskforce for the under-25s. We are committed to an energy policy
designed to promote cleaner, more efficient energy use and production, including
a new and strong drive to develop renewable energy sources such as solar and
wind energy, and combined heat and power. We see no economic case for the
building of any new nuclear power stations.
Key elements of the 1980s trade union reforms to stay
There must be minimum standards for the individual at work, including a minimum
wage, within a flexible labour market. We need a sensible balance in industrial
relations law - rights and duties go together.
The key elements of the trade union legislation of the 1980s will stay - on
ballots, picketing and industrial action. People should be free to join or not
to join a union. Where they do decide to join, and where a majority of the
relevant workforce vote in a ballot for the union to represent them, the union
should be recognised. This promotes stable and orderly industrial relations.
There will be full consultation on the most effective means of implementing this
proposal.
Partnership at work
The best companies recognise their employees as partners in the enterprise.
Employees whose conditions are good are more committed to their companies and
are more productive. Many unions and employers are embracing partnership in
place of conflict. Government should welcome this.
We are keen to encourage a variety of forms of partnership and enterprise,
spreading ownership and encouraging more employees to become owners through
Employee Share Ownership Plans and co-operatives. We support too the Social
Chapter of the EU, but will deploy our influence in Europe to ensure that it
develops so as to promote employability and competitiveness, not inflexibility.
A sensibly set national minimum wage
There should be a statutory level beneath which pay should not fall - with the
minimum wage decided not on the basis of a rigid formula but according to the
economic circumstances of the time and with the advice of an independent low pay
commission, whose membership will include representatives of employers,
including small business, and employees.
Every modern industrial country has a minimum wage, including the US and Japan.
Britain used to have minimum wages through the Wages Councils. Introduced
sensibly, the minimum wage will remove the worst excesses of low pay (and be of
particular benefit to women), while cutting some of the massive £4 billion
benefits bill by which the taxpayer subsidises companies that pay very low
wages.
We will get the unemployed from welfare to work
  Stop the growth of an 'underclass' in Britain
  250,000 young unemployed off benefit and into work
  Tax cuts for employers who create new jobs for the long-term unemployed
  Effective help for lone parents
There are over one million fewer jobs in Britain than in 1990. One in five
families has no one working. One million single mothers are trapped on benefits.
There is a wider gap between rich and poor than for generations.
We are determined not to continue down the road of a permanent have-not class,
unemployed and disaffected from society. Our long-term objective is high and
stable levels of employment. This is the true meaning of a stakeholder economy -
where everyone has a stake in society and owes responsibilities to it.
The best way to tackle poverty is to help people into jobs - real jobs. The
unemployed have a responsibility to take up the opportunity of training places
or work, but these must be real opportunities. The government's workfare
proposals - with a success rate of one in ten - fail this test.
Labour's welfare-to-work programme will attack unemployment and break the spiral
of escalating spending on social security. A one-off windfall levy on the excess
profits of the privatised utilities will fund our ambitious programme.
Every young person unemployed for more than six months in a job or training
We will give 250,000 under-25s opportunities for work, education and training.
Four options will be on offer, each involving day-release education or training
leading to a qualification: private-sector job: employers will be offered a 60
pound-a-week rebate for six months work with a non-profit voluntary sector
employer, paying a weekly wage, equivalent to benefit plus a fixed sum for six
months full-time study for young people without qualifications on an approved
course a job with the environment taskforce, linked to Labour's citizens'
service programme. Rights and responsibilities must go hand in hand, without a
fifth option of life on full benefit.
Every 16 and 17 year-old on the road to a proper qualification by the year 2000
Nearly a third of young people do not achieve an NVQ level two qualification by
age 19. All young people will be offered part-time or full-time education after
the age of 16. Any under-18 year-old in a job will have the right to study on an
approved course for qualifications at college. We will replace the failed Youth
Training scheme with our new Target 2000 programme, offering young people
high-quality education and training.
Action on long-term unemployment
New partnerships between government and business, fully involving local
authorities and the voluntary sector, will attack long-term joblessness. We will
encourage employers to take on those who have suffered unemployment for more
than two years with a 75 pound-a-week tax rebate paid for six months, financed
by the windfall levy. Our programme for the phased release of past receipts from
council house sales will provide new jobs in the construction industry.
Lone parents into work
Today the main connection between unemployed lone parents and the state is their
benefits. Most lone parents want to work, but are given no help to find it. New
Labour has a positive policy. Once the youngest child is in the second term of
full-time school, lone parents will be offered advice by a proactive Employment
Service to develop a package of job search, training and after-school care to
help them off benefit.
Customised, personalised services
We favour initiatives with new combinations of available benefits to suit
individual circumstances. In new and innovative 'Employment Zones', personal job
accounts will combine money currently available for benefits and training, to
offer the unemployed new options - leading to work and independence. We will
co-ordinate benefits, employment and career services, and utilise new technology
to improve their quality and efficiency.
Fraud
Just as we owe it to the taxpayer to crack down on tax avoidance, so we must
crack down on dishonesty in the benefit system. We will start with a clampdown
on Housing Benefit fraud, estimated to cost £2 billion a year, and will maintain
action against benefit fraud of all kinds.
We will save the NHS
  100,000 people off waiting lists
  End the Tory internal market
  End waiting for cancer surgery
  Tough quality targets for hospitals
  Independent food standards agency
  New public health drive
  Raise spending in real terms every year - and spend the money on patients not
  bureaucracy
Labour created the NHS 50 years ago. It is under threat from the Conservatives.
We want to save and modernise the NHS.
But if the Conservatives are elected again there may well not be an NHS in five
years' time - neither national nor comprehensive. Labour commits itself anew to
the historic principle: that if you are ill or injured there will be a national
health service there to help; and access to it will be based on need and need
alone - not on your ability to pay, or on who your GP happens to be or on where
you live.
In 1990 the Conservatives imposed on the NHS a complex internal market of
hospitals competing to win contracts from health authorities and fundholding
GPs. The result is an NHS strangled by costly red tape, with every individual
transaction the subject of a separate invoice. After six years, bureaucracy
swallows an extra £1.5 billion per year; there are 20,000 more managers and
50,000 fewer nurses on the wards; and more than one million people are on
waiting lists. The government has consistently failed to meet even its own
health targets.
There can be no return to top-down management, but Labour will end the
Conservatives' internal market in healthcare. The planning and provision of care
are necessary and distinct functions, and will remain so. But under the Tories,
the administrative costs of purchasing care have undermined provision and the
market system has distorted clinical priorities. Labour will cut costs by
removing the bureaucratic processes of the internal market.
The savings achieved will go on direct care for patients. As a start, the first
£100 million saved will treat an extra 100,000 patients. We will end waiting for
cancer surgery, thereby helping thousands of women waiting for breast cancer
treatment.
Primary care will play a lead role
In recent years, GPs have gained power on behalf of their patients in a changed
relationship with consultants, and we support this. But the development of GP
fundholding has also brought disadvantages. Decision-making has been fragmented.
Administrative costs have grown. And a two-tier service has resulted.
Labour will retain the lead role for primary care but remove the disadvantages
that have come from the present system. GPs and nurses will take the lead in
combining together locally to plan local health services more efficiently for
all the patients in their area. This will enable all GPs in an area to bring
their combined strength to bear upon individual hospitals to secure higher
standards of patient provision. In making this change, we will build on the
existing collaborative schemes which already serve 14 million people.
The current system of year-on-year contracts is costly and unstable. We will
introduce three- to five-year agreements between the local primary care teams
and hospitals. Hospitals will then be better able to plan work at full capacity
and co-operate to enhance patient services.
Higher-quality services for patients
Hospitals will retain their autonomy over day-to-day administrative functions,
but, as part of the NHS, they will be required to meet high-quality standards in
the provision of care. Management will be held to account for performance
levels. Boards will become more representative of the local communities they
serve. A new patients' charter will concentrate on the quality and success of
treatment. The Tories' so-called 'Efficiency Index' counts the number of patient
'episodes', not the quality or success of treatment. With Labour, the measure
will be quality of outcome, itself an incentive for effectiveness. As part of
our concern to ensure quality, we will work towards the elimination of mixed-sex
wards.
Health authorities will become the guardians of high standards. They will
monitor services, spread best practice and ensure rising standards of care.
The Tory attempt to use private money to build hospitals has failed to deliver.
Labour will overcome the problems that have plagued the Private Finance
Initiative, end the delays, sort out the confusion and develop new forms of
public/private partnership that work better and protect the interests of the
NHS. Labour is opposed to the privatisation of clinical services which is being
actively promoted by the Conservatives.
Labour will promote new developments in telemedicine - bringing expert advice
from regional centres of excellence to neighbourhood level using new technology.

Good health
A new minister for public health will attack the root causes of ill health, and
so improve lives and save the NHS money. Labour will set new goals for improving
the overall health of the nation which recognise the impact that poverty, poor
housing, unemployment and a polluted environment have on health.
Smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death
in the UK. We will therefore ban tobacco advertising.
Labour will establish an independent food standards agency. The £3.5 billion BSE
crisis and the E. coli outbreak which resulted in serious loss of life, have
made unanswerable the case for the independent agency we have proposed.
NHS spending
The Conservatives have wasted spending on the NHS. We will do better. We will
raise spending on the NHS in real terms every year and put the money towards
patient care. And a greater proportion of every pound spent will go on patient
care not bureaucracy.
An NHS for the future
The NHS requires continuity as well as change, or the system cannot cope. There
must be pilots to ensure that change works. And there must be flexibility, not
rigid prescription, if innovation is to flourish.
Our fundamental purpose is simple but hugely important: to restore the NHS as a
public service working co-operatively for patients, not a commercial business
driven by competition.
We will be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime
  Fast-track punishment for persistent young offenders
  Reform Crown Prosecution Service to convict more criminals
  Police on the beat not pushing paper
  Crackdown on petty crimes and neighbourhood disorder
  Fresh parliamentary vote to ban all handguns
Under the Conservatives, crime has doubled and many more criminals get away with
their crimes: the number of people convicted has fallen by a third, with only
one crime in 50 leading to a conviction. This is the worst record of any
government since the Second World War - and for England and Wales the worst
record of any major industrialised country. Last year alone violent crime rose
11 per cent.
We propose a new approach to law and order: tough on crime and tough on the
causes of crime. We insist on individual responsibility for crime, and will
attack the causes of crime by our measures to relieve social deprivation.
The police have our strong support. They are in the front line of the fight
against crime and disorder. The Conservatives have broken their 1992 general
election pledge to provide an extra 1,000 police officers. We will relieve the
police of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens to get more officers back on the
beat.
Youth crime
Youth crime and disorder have risen sharply, but very few young offenders end up
in court, and when they do half are let off with another warning. Young
offenders account for seven million crimes a year.
Far too often young criminals offend again and again while waiting months for a
court hearing. We will halve the time it takes to get persistent young offenders
from arrest to sentencing; replace widespread repeat cautions with a single
final warning; bring together Youth Offender Teams in every area; and streamline
the system of youth courts to make it far more effective.
New parental responsibility orders will make parents face up to their
responsibility for their children's misbehaviour.
Conviction and sentencing
The job of the Crown Prosecution Service is to prosecute criminals effectively.
There is strong evidence that the CPS is over-centralised, bureaucratic and
inefficient, with cases too often dropped, delayed, or downgraded to lesser
offences.
Labour will decentralise the CPS, with local crown prosecutors co-operating more
effectively with local police forces.
We will implement an effective sentencing system for all the main offences to
ensure greater consistency and stricter punishment for serious repeat offenders.
The courts will have to spell out what each sentence really means in practice.
The Court of Appeal will have a duty to lay down sentencing guidelines for all
the main offences. The attorney general's power to appeal unduly lenient
sentences will be extended.
The prison service now faces serious financial problems. We will audit the
resources available, take proper ministerial responsibility for the service, and
seek to ensure that prison regimes are constructive and require inmates to face
up to their offending behaviour.
Disorder
The Conservatives have forgotten the 'order' part of 'law and order'. We will
tackle the unacceptable level of anti-social behaviour and crime on our streets.
Our 'zero tolerance' approach will ensure that petty criminality among young
offenders is seriously addressed.
Community safety orders will deal with threatening and disruptive criminal
neighbours. Labour has taken the lead in proposing action to tackle the problems
of stalking and domestic violence.
Child protection orders will deal with young children suffering neglect by
parents because they are left out on their own far too late at night.
Britain is a multiracial and multicultural society. All its members must have
the protection of the law. We will create a new offence of racial harassment and
a new crime of racially motivated violence to protect ethnic minorities from
intimidation.
Drugs
The vicious circle of drugs and crime wrecks lives and threatens communities.
Labour will appoint an anti-drugs supremo to co-ordinate our battle against
drugs across all government departments. The 'drug czar' will be a symbol of our
commitment to tackle the modern menace of drugs in our communities.
We will pilot the use of compulsory drug testing and treatment orders for
offenders to ensure that the link between drug addiction and crime is broken.
This will be paid for by bringing remand delays down to the national targets.
We will attack the drug problem in prisons. In addition to random drug testing
of all prisoners we will aim for a voluntary testing unit in every prison for
prisoners ready to prove they are drug-free.
Victims
Victims of crime are too often neglected by the criminal justice system. We will
ensure that victims are kept fully informed of the progress of their case, and
why charges may have been downgraded or dropped.
Greater protection will be provided for victims in rape and serious sexual
offence trials and for those subject to intimidation, including witnesses.
Prevention
We will place a new responsibility on local authorities to develop statutory
partnerships to help prevent crime. Local councils will then be required to set
targets for the reduction of crime and disorder in their area.
Gun control
In the wake of Dunblane and Hungerford, it is clear that only the strictest
firearms laws can provide maximum safety. The Conservatives failed to offer the
protection required. Labour led the call for an outright ban on all handguns in
general civilian use. There will be legislation to allow individual MPs a free
vote for a complete ban on handguns.
Labour is the party of law and order in Britain today.
We will strengthen family life
  Help parents balance work and family
  Security in housing and help for homeowners
  Tackle homelessness using receipts from council house sales
  Dignity and security in retirement
  Protect the basic state pension and promote secure second pensions
We will uphold family life as the most secure means of bringing up our children.
Families are the core of our society. They should teach right from wrong. They
should be the first defence against anti-social behaviour. The breakdown of
family life damages the fabric of our society.
Labour does not see families and the state as rival providers for the needs of
our citizens. Families should provide the day-to-day support for children to be
brought up in a stable and loving environment. But families cannot flourish
unless government plays its distinctive role: in education; where necessary, in
caring for the young; in making adequate provision for illness and old age; in
supporting good parenting; and in protecting families from lawlessness and abuse
of power. Society, through government, must assist families to achieve
collectively what no family can achieve alone.
Yet families in Britain today are under strain as never before. The security
once offered by the health service has been undermined. Streets are not safe.
Housing insecurity grows. One in five non-pensioner families has no one working;
and British men work the longest hours in Europe.
The clock should not be turned back. As many women who want to work should be
able to do so. More equal relationships between men and women have transformed
our lives. Equally, our attitudes to race, sex and sexuality have changed
fundamentally. Our task is to combine change and social stability.
Work and family
Families without work are without independence. This is why we give so much
emphasis to our welfare-to-work policies.
Labour's national childcare strategy will plan provision to match the
requirements of the modern labour market and help parents, especially women, to
balance family and working life.
There must be a sound balance between support for family life and the protection
of business from undue burdens - a balance which some of the most successful
businesses already strike. The current government has shown itself wholly
insensitive to the need to help develop family-friendly working practices. While
recognising the need for flexibility in implementation and for certain
exemptions, we support the right of employees not to be forced to work more than
48 hours a week; to an annual holiday entitlement; and to limited unpaid
parental leave. These measures will provide a valuable underpinning to family
life.
The rights of part-time workers have been clarified by recent court judgements
which we welcome.
We will keep under continuous review all aspects of the tax and benefits systems
to ensure that they are supportive of families and children. We are committed to
retain universal Child Benefit where it is universal today - from birth to age
16 - and to uprate it at least in line with prices. We are reviewing educational
finance and maintenance for those older than 16 to ensure higher staying-on
rates at school and college, and that resources are used to support those in
most need. This review will continue in government on the guidelines we have
already laid down.
Security in housing
Most families want to own their own homes. We will also support efficiently run
social and private rented sectors offering quality and choice.
The Conservatives' failure on housing has been twofold. The two thirds of
families who own their homes have suffered a massive increase in insecurity over
the last decade, with record mortgage arrears, record negative equity and record
repossessions. And the Conservatives' lack of a housing strategy has led to the
virtual abandonment of social housing, the growth of homelessness, and a failure
to address fully leaseholder reform. All these are the Tory legacy.
Labour's housing strategy will address the needs of homeowners and tenants
alike.
We will reject the boom and bust policies which caused the collapse of the
housing market.
We will work with mortgage providers to encourage greater provision of more
flexible mortgages to protect families in a world of increased job insecurity.
Mortgage buyers also require stronger consumer protection, for example by
extension of the Financial Services Act, against the sale of disadvantageous
mortgage packages.
The problems of gazumping have reappeared. Those who break their bargains should
be liable to pay the costs inflicted on others, in particular legal and survey
costs. We are consulting on the best way of tackling the problems of gazumping
in the interests of responsible home buyers and sellers.
The rented housing sector
We support a three-way partnership between the public, private and housing
association sectors to promote good social housing. With Labour, capital
receipts from the sale of council houses, received but not spent by local
councils, will be re-invested in building new houses and rehabilitating old
ones. This will be phased to match the capacity of the building industry and to
meet the requirements of prudent economic management.
We also support effective schemes to deploy private finance to improve the
public housing stock and to introduce greater diversity and choice. Such schemes
should only go ahead with the support of the tenants concerned: we oppose the
government's threat to hand over council housing to private landlords without
the consent of tenants and with no guarantees on rents or security of tenure.
We value a revived private rented sector. We will provide protection where most
needed: for tenants in houses in multiple occupation. There will be a proper
system of licensing by local authorities which will benefit tenants and
responsible landlords alike.
We will introduce 'commonhold', a new form of tenure enabling people living in
flats to own their homes individually and to own the whole property
collectively. We will simplify the current rules restricting the purchase of
freeholds by leaseholders.
Homelessness
Homelessness has more than doubled under the Conservatives. Today more than
40,000 families in England are in expensive temporary accommodation. The
government, in the face of Labour opposition, has removed the duty on local
authorities to find permanent housing for homeless families. We will impose a
new duty on local authorities to protect those who are homeless through no fault
of their own and are in priority need.
There is no more powerful symbol of Tory neglect in our society today than young
people without homes living rough on the streets. Young people emerging from
care without any family support are particularly vulnerable. We will attack the
problem in two principal ways: the phased release of capital receipts from
council house sales will increase the stock of housing for rent; and our
welfare-to-work programme will lead the young unemployed into work and financial
independence.
Older citizens
We value the positive contribution that older people make to our society,
through their families, voluntary activities and work. Their skills and
experience should be utilised within their communities. That is why, for
example, we support the proposal to involve older people as volunteers to help
children learn in pre-school and after-school clubs. In work, they should not be
discriminated against because of their age.
The provision of adequate pensions in old age is a major challenge for the
future. For today's pensioners Conservative policies have created real poverty,
growing inequality and widespread insecurity.
The Conservatives would abolish the state-financed basic retirement pension and
replace it with a privatised scheme, with a vague promise of a means-tested
state guarantee if pensions fall beneath a minimum level. Their proposals mean
there will be no savings on welfare spending for half a century; and taxes will
have to rise to make provision for new privately funded pensions. Their plans
require an additional £312 billion between now and 2040 through increased taxes
or borrowing, against the hope of savings later, with no certainty of security
in retirement at the end.
We believe that all pensioners should share fairly in the increasing prosperity
of the nation. Instead of privatisation, we propose a partnership between public
and private provision, and a balance between income sourced from tax and
invested savings. The basic state pension will be retained as the foundation of
pension provision. It will be increased at least in line with prices. We will
examine means of delivering more automatic help to the poorest pensioners - one
million of whom do not even receive the Income Support which is their present
entitlement.
We will encourage saving for retirement, with proper protection for savings. We
will reform the Financial Services Act so that the scandal of pension
mis-selling - 600,000 pensions mis-sold and only 7,000 people compensated to
date - will not happen again.
Too many people in work, particularly those on low and modest incomes and with
changing patterns of employment, cannot join good-value second pension schemes.
Labour will create a new framework - stakeholder pensions - to meet this need.
We will encourage new partnerships between financial service companies,
employers and employees to develop these pension schemes. They will be approved
to receive people's savings only if they meet high standards of value for money,
flexibility and security.
Labour will promote choice in pension provision. We will support and strengthen
the framework for occupational pensions. Personal pensions, appropriately
regulated, will remain a good option for many. Labour will retain SERPS as an
option for those who wish to remain within it. We will also seek to develop the
administrative structure of SERPS so as to create a 'citizenship pension' for
those who assume responsibility as carers, as a result lose out on the pension
entitlements they would otherwise acquire, and currently end up on means-tested
benefits.
We overcame government opposition to pension splitting between women and men on
divorce. We will implement this in government.
We aim to provide real security for families through a modern system of
community care. As people grow older, their need for care increases. The
Conservative approach is to promote private insurance and privatisation of care
homes. But private insurance will be inaccessible to most people. And their
policy for residential homes is dogmatic and will not work. We believe that
local authorities should be free to develop a mix of public and private care.
We recognise the immense amount of care provision undertaken by family members,
neighbours and friends. It was a Labour MP who piloted the 1995 Carers Act
through Parliament. We will establish a Royal Commission to work out a fair
system for funding long-term care for the elderly. We will introduce a
'long-term care charter' defining the standard of services which people are
entitled to expect from health, housing and social services. We are committed to
an independent inspection and regulation service for residential homes, and
domiciliary care.
Everyone is entitled to dignity in retirement. Under the Tories, the earnings
link for state pensions has been ended, VAT on fuel has been imposed, SERPS has
been undermined and community care is in tatters. We will set up a review of the
central areas of insecurity for elderly people: all aspects of the basic pension
and its value, second pensions including SERPS, and community care. The review
will ensure that the views of pensioners are heard. Our watchword in developing
policy for pensions and long-term care will be to build consensus among all
interested parties.
We will help you get more out of life
  Every government department a 'green' department
  Efficient and clean transport for all
  New arts and science talent fund for young people
  Reform the lottery
  Improve life in rural areas
  Back World Cup bid
The millennium is the time to reaffirm our responsibility to protect and enhance
our environment so that the country we hand on to our children and our
grandchildren is a better place in which to live. It also provides a natural
opportunity to celebrate and improve the contribution made by the arts, culture
and sport to our nation. We need a new and dynamic approach to the 'creative
economy'. The Department of National Heritage will develop a strategic vision
that matches the real power and energy of British arts, media and cultural
industries.
Protecting the environment
Our generation, and generations yet to come, are dependent on the integrity of
the environment. No one can escape unhealthy water, polluted air or adverse
climate change. And just as these problems affect us all, so we must act
together to tackle them. No responsible government can afford to take risks with
the future: the cost is too high. So it is our duty to act now.
The foundation of Labour's environmental approach is that protection of the
environment cannot be the sole responsibility of any one department of state.
All departments must promote policies to sustain the environment. And Parliament
should have an environmental audit committee to ensure high standards across
government.
Throughout this manifesto, there are policies designed to combine environmental
sustainability with economic and social progress. They extend from commitments
at local level to give communities enhanced control over their environments, to
initiatives at international level to ensure that all countries are contributing
to the protection of the environment.
A sustainable environment requires above all an effective and integrated
transport policy at national, regional and local level that will provide genuine
choice to meet people's transport needs. That is what we will establish and
develop.
Railways
The process of rail privatisation is now largely complete. It has made fortunes
for a few, but has been a poor deal for the taxpayer. It has fragmented the
network and now threatens services. Our task will be to improve the situation as
we find it, not as we wish it to be. Our overriding goal must be to win more
passengers and freight on to rail. The system must be run in the public interest
with higher levels of investment and effective enforcement of train operators'
service commitments. There must be convenient connections, through-ticketing and
accurate travel information for the benefit of all passengers.
To achieve these aims, we will establish more effective and accountable
regulation by the rail regulator; we will ensure that the public subsidy serves
the public interest; and we will establish a new rail authority, combining
functions currently carried out by the rail franchiser and the Department of
Transport, to provide a clear, coherent and strategic programme for the
development of the railways so that passenger expectations are met.
The Conservative plan for the wholesale privatisation of London Underground is
not the answer. It would be a poor deal for the taxpayer and passenger alike.
Yet again, public assets would be sold off at an under-valued rate. Much-needed
investment would be delayed. The core public responsibilities of the Underground
would be threatened.
Labour plans a new public/private partnership to improve the Underground,
safeguard its commitment to the public interest and guarantee value for money to
taxpayers and passengers.
Road transport
A balanced transport system must cater for all the familiar modes of transport:
cars - whether owned, leased or shared; taxis; buses; bicycles and motorcycles.
All needs must be addressed in transport planning to ensure the best mix of all
types of transport, offer quality public transport wherever possible and help to
protect the environment.
The key to efficient bus services is proper regulation at local level, with
partnerships between local councils and bus operators an essential component.
There must be improved provision and enforcement of bus lanes. Better parking
facilities for cars must be linked to convenient bus services to town centres.
Road safety is a high priority. Cycling and walking must be made safer,
especially around schools.
We remain unpersuaded by the case for heavier, 44-tonne lorries mooted by the
Conservatives. Our concern is that they would prove dangerous and damaging to
the environment.
Our plans to reduce pollution include working with the automotive industry to
develop 'smart', efficient and clean cars for the future, with substantially
reduced emission levels. The review of vehicle excise duty to promote
low-emission vehicles will be continued.
We will conduct an overall strategic review of the roads programme against the
criteria of accessibility, safety, economy and environmental impact, using
public/private partnerships to improve road maintenance and exploiting new
technology to improve journey information.
Shipping and aviation
The Tory years have seen the near-extinction of Britain's merchant fleet. Labour
will work with all concerned in shipping and ports to help develop their
economic potential to the full.
The guiding objectives of our aviation strategy will be fair competition, safety
and environmental standards. We want all British carriers to be able to compete
fairly in the interests of consumers.
Life in our countryside
Labour recognises the special needs of people who live and work in rural areas.
The Conservatives do not. Public services and transport services in rural areas
must not be allowed to deteriorate. The Conservatives have tried to privatise
the Post Office. We opposed that, in favour of a public Post Office providing a
comprehensive service. Conservative plans would mean higher charges for letters
and put rural post offices under threat.
We favour a moratorium on large-scale sales of Forestry Commission land. We
recognise that the countryside is a great natural asset, a part of our heritage
which calls for careful stewardship. This must be balanced, however, with the
needs of people who live and work in rural areas.
The total failure of the Conservatives to manage the BSE crisis effectively and
to secure any raising of the ban on British beef has wreaked havoc on the beef
and dairy industries. The cost to the taxpayer so far is £3.5 billion.
Labour aims to reform the Common Agricultural Policy to save money, to support
the rural economy and enhance the environment.
Our initiatives to link all schools to the information superhighway will ensure
that children in rural areas have access to the best educational resources.
Our policies include greater freedom for people to explore our open countryside.
We will not, however, permit any abuse of a right to greater access.
We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures
to promote animal welfare, including a free vote in Parliament on whether
hunting with hounds should be banned by legislation.
Angling is Britain's most popular sport. Labour's anglers' charter affirms our
long-standing commitment to angling and to the objective of protecting the
aquatic environment.
Arts and culture
The arts, culture and sport are central to the task of recreating the sense of
community, identity and civic pride that should define our country. Yet we
consistently undervalue the role of the arts and culture in helping to create a
civic society - from amateur theatre to our art galleries.
Art, sport and leisure are vital to our quality of life and the renewal of our
economy. They are significant earners for Britain. They employ hundreds of
thousands of people. They bring millions of tourists to Britain every year, who
will also be helped by Labour's plans for new quality assurance in hotel
accommodation.
We propose to set up a National Endowment for Science and the Arts to sponsor
young talent. NESTA will be a national trust - for talent rather than buildings
- for the 21st century. NESTA will be partly funded by the lottery; and artists
who have gained high rewards from their excellence in the arts and wish to
support young talent will be encouraged to donate copyright and royalties to
NESTA.
Sport
A Labour government will take the lead in extending opportunities for
participation in sports; and in identifying sporting excellence and supporting
it.
School sports must be the foundation. We will bring the government's policy of
forcing schools to sell off playing fields to an end. We will provide full
backing to the bid to host the 2006 football World Cup in England. A Labour
government will also work to bring the Olympics and other major international
sporting events to Britain.
A people's lottery
The lottery has been a financial success. But there has been no overall strategy
for the allocation of monies; and no co-ordination among the five distributor
bodies about the projects deserving to benefit from lottery funding. For
example, the multi-million-pound expenditure on the Churchill papers caused
national outrage. A Labour government will review the distribution of lottery
proceeds to ensure that there is the widest possible access to the benefits of
lottery revenues throughout the UK.
Labour has already proposed a new millennium commission to commence after the
closure of the Millennium Exhibition, to provide direct support for a range of
education, environment and public health projects, including those directed at
children's play, a project currently excluded from lottery benefit.
Because the lottery is a monopoly intended to serve the public interest, it must
be administered efficiently and economically. When the current contract runs
out, Labour will seek an efficient not-for-profit operator to ensure that the
maximum sums go to good causes.
Media and broadcasting
Labour aims for a thriving, diverse media industry, combining commercial success
and public service. We will ensure that the BBC continues to be a flagship for
British creativity and public service broadcasting, but we believe that the
combination of public and private sectors in competition is a key spur to
innovation and high standards. The regulatory framework for media and
broadcasting should reflect the realities of a far more open and competitive
economy, and enormous technological advance, for example with digital
television. Labour will balance sensible rules, fair regulation and national and
international competition, so maintaining quality and diversity for the benefit
of viewers.
Citizens' service for a new millennium
An independent and creative voluntary sector, committed to voluntary activity as
an expression of citizenship, is central to our vision of a stakeholder society.
We are committed to developing plans for a national citizens' service programme,
to tap the enthusiasm and commitment of the many young people who want to make
voluntary contributions in service of their communities. The millennium should
harness the imagination of all those people who have so much to offer for the
benefit of the community. We do not believe programmes should be imposed from
the top down, but on the contrary wish to encourage a broad range of voluntary
initiatives devised and developed by people within their own communities.
We will clean up politics
  End the hereditary principle in the House of Lords
  Reform of party funding to end sleaze
  Devolved power in Scotland and Wales
  Elected mayors for London and other cities
  More independent but accountable local government
  Freedom of information and guaranteed human rights
The Conservatives seem opposed to the very idea of democracy. They support
hereditary peers, unaccountable quangos and secretive government. They have
debased democracy through their MPs who have taken cash for asking questions in
the House of Commons. They are opposed to the development of decentralised
government. The party which once opposed universal suffrage and votes for women
now says our constitution is so perfect that it cannot be improved.
Our system of government is centralised, inefficient and bureaucratic. Our
citizens cannot assert their basic rights in our own courts. The Conservatives
are afflicted by sleaze and prosper from secret funds from foreign supporters.
There is unquestionably a national crisis of confidence in our political system,
to which Labour will respond in a measured and sensible way.
A modern House of Lords
The House of Lords must be reformed. As an initial, self-contained reform, not
dependent on further reform in the future, the right of hereditary peers to sit
and vote in the House of Lords will be ended by statute. This will be the first
stage in a process of reform to make the House of Lords more democratic and
representative. The legislative powers of the House of Lords will remain
unaltered.
The system of appointment of life peers to the House of Lords will be reviewed.
Our objective will be to ensure that over time party appointees as life peers
more accurately reflect the proportion of votes cast at the previous general
election. We are committed to maintaining an independent cross-bench presence of
life peers. No one political party should seek a majority in the House of Lords.
A committee of both Houses of Parliament will be appointed to undertake a
wide-ranging review of possible further change and then to bring forward
proposals for reform.
We have no plans to replace the monarchy.
An effective House of Commons
We believe the House of Commons is in need of modernisation and we will ask the
House to establish a special Select Committee to review its procedures. Prime
Minister's Questions will be made more effective. Ministerial accountability
will be reviewed so as to remove recent abuses. The process for scrutinising
European legislation will be overhauled.
The Nolan recommendations will be fully implemented and extended to all public
bodies. We will oblige parties to declare the source of all donations above a
minimum figure: Labour does this voluntarily and all parties should do so.
Foreign funding will be banned. We will ask the Nolan Committee to consider how
the funding of political parties should be regulated and reformed.
We are committed to a referendum on the voting system for the House of Commons.
An independent commission on voting systems will be appointed early to recommend
a proportional alternative to the first-past-the-post system.
At this election, Labour is proud to be making major strides to rectify the
under-representation of women in public life.
Open government
Unnecessary secrecy in government leads to arrogance in government and defective
policy decisions. The Scott Report on arms to Iraq revealed Conservative abuses
of power. We are pledged to a Freedom of Information Act, leading to more open
government, and an independent National Statistical Service.
Devolution: strengthening the Union
The United Kingdom is a partnership enriched by distinct national identities and
traditions. Scotland has its own systems of education, law and local government.
Wales has its language and cultural traditions. We will meet the demand for
decentralisation of power to Scotland and Wales, once established in
referendums.
Subsidiarity is as sound a principle in Britain as it is in Europe. Our proposal
is for devolution not federation. A sovereign Westminster Parliament will
devolve power to Scotland and Wales. The Union will be strengthened and the
threat of separatism removed.
As soon as possible after the election, we will enact legislation to allow the
people of Scotland and Wales to vote in separate referendums on our proposals,
which will be set out in white papers. These referendums will take place not
later than the autumn of 1997. A simple majority of those voting in each
referendum will be the majority required. Popular endorsement will strengthen
the legitimacy of our proposals and speed their passage through Parliament.
For Scotland we propose the creation of a parliament with law-making powers,
firmly based on the agreement reached in the Scottish Constitutional Convention,
including defined and limited financial powers to vary revenue and elected by an
additional member system. In the Scottish referendum we will seek separate
endorsement of the proposal to create a parliament, and of the proposal to give
it defined and limited financial powers to vary revenue. The Scottish parliament
will extend democratic control over the responsibilities currently exercised
administratively by the Scottish Office. The responsibilities of the UK
Parliament will remain unchanged over UK policy, for example economic, defence
and foreign policy.
The Welsh assembly will provide democratic control of the existing Welsh Office
functions. It will have secondary legislative powers and will be specifically
empowered to reform and democratise the quango state. It will be elected by an
additional member system.
Following majorities in the referendums, we will introduce in the first year of
the Parliament legislation on the substantive devolution proposals outlined in
our white papers.
Good local government
Local decision-making should be less constrained by central government, and also
more accountable to local people. We will place on councils a new duty to
promote the economic, social and environmental well-being of their area. They
should work in partnership with local people, local business and local voluntary
organisations. They will have the powers necessary to develop these
partnerships. To ensure greater accountability, a proportion of councillors in
each locality will be elected annually. We will encourage democratic innovations
in local government, including pilots of the idea of elected mayors with
executive powers in cities.
Although crude and universal council tax capping should go, we will retain
reserve powers to control excessive council tax rises.
Local business concerns are critical to good local government. There are sound
democratic reasons why, in principle, the business rate should be set locally,
not nationally. But we will make no change to the present system for determining
the business rate without full consultation with business.
The funnelling of government grant to Conservative-controlled Westminster speaks
volumes about the unfairness of the current grant system. Labour is committed to
a fair distribution of government grant. The basic framework, not every detail,
of local service provision must be for central government. Councils should not
be forced to put their services out to tender, but will be required to obtain
best value. We reject the dogmatic view that services must be privatised to be
of high quality, but equally we see no reason why a service should be delivered
directly if other more efficient means are available. Cost counts but so does
quality.
Every council will be required to publish a local performance plan with targets
for service improvement, and be expected to achieve them. The Audit Commission
will be given additional powers to monitor performance and promote efficiency.
On its advice, government will where necessary send in a management team with
full powers to remedy failure.
Labour councils have been at the forefront of environmental initiatives under
Local Agenda 21, the international framework for local action arising from the
1992 Earth Summit. A Labour government will encourage all local authorities to
adopt plans to protect and enhance their local environment.
Local government is at the sharp end of the fight against deprivation. Ten years
after the Conservatives promised to improve the inner cities, poverty and social
division afflict towns and outer estates alike. A Labour government will join
with local government in a concerted attack against the multiple causes of
social and economic decline - unemployment, bad housing, crime, poor health and
a degraded environment.
London
London is the only Western capital without an elected city government. Following
a referendum to confirm popular demand, there will be a new deal for London,
with a strategic authority and a mayor, each directly elected. Both will speak
up for the needs of the city and plan its future. They will not duplicate the
work of the boroughs, but take responsibility for London-wide issues - economic
regeneration, planning, policing, transport and environmental protection.
London-wide responsibility for its own government is urgently required. We will
make it happen.
The regions of England
The Conservatives have created a tier of regional government in England through
quangos and government regional offices. Meanwhile local authorities have come
together to create a more co-ordinated regional voice. Labour will build on
these developments through the establishment of regional chambers to co-ordinate
transport, planning, economic development, bids for European funding and land
use planning.
Demand for directly elected regional government so varies across England that it
would be wrong to impose a uniform system. In time we will introduce legislation
to allow the people, region by region, to decide in a referendum whether they
want directly elected regional government. Only where clear popular consent is
established will arrangements be made for elected regional assemblies. This
would require a predominantly unitary system of local government, as presently
exists in Scotland and Wales, and confirmation by independent auditors that no
additional public expenditure overall would be involved. Our plans will not mean
adding a new tier of government to the existing English system.
Real rights for citizens
Citizens should have statutory rights to enforce their human rights in the UK
courts. We will by statute incorporate the European Convention on Human Rights
into UK law to bring these rights home and allow our people access to them in
their national courts. The incorporation of the European Convention will
establish a floor, not a ceiling, for human rights. Parliament will remain free
to enhance these rights, for example by a Freedom of Information Act.
We will seek to end unjustifiable discrimination wherever it exists. For
example, we support comprehensive, enforceable civil rights for disabled people
against discrimination in society or at work, developed in partnership with all
interested parties.
Labour will undertake a wide-ranging review both of the reform of the civil
justice system and Legal Aid. We will achieve value for money for the taxpayer
and the consumer. A community legal service will develop local, regional and
national plans for the development of Legal Aid according to the needs and
priorities of regions and areas. The key to success will be to promote a
partnership between the voluntary sector, the legal profession and the Legal Aid
Board.
Every country must have firm control over immigration and Britain is no
exception. All applications, however, should be dealt with speedily and fairly.
There are, rightly, criteria for those who want to enter this country to join
husband or wife. We will ensure that these are properly enforced. We will,
however, reform the system in current use to remove the arbitrary and unfair
results that can follow from the existing 'primary purpose' rule. There will be
a streamlined system of appeals for visitors denied a visa.
The system for dealing with asylum seekers is expensive and slow - there are
many undecided cases dating back beyond 1993. We will ensure swift and fair
decisions on whether someone can stay or go, control unscrupulous immigration
advisors and crack down on the fraudulent use of birth certificates.
Northern Ireland
Labour's approach to the peace process has been bipartisan. We have supported
the recent agreements between the two governments - the Anglo-Irish Agreement,
the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document. The government has
tabled proposals which include a new devolved legislative body, as well as
cross-border co-operation and continued dialogue between the two governments.
There will be as great a priority attached to seeing that process through with
Labour as under the Conservatives, in co-operation with the Irish government and
the Northern Ireland parties. We will expect the same bipartisan approach from a
Conservative opposition.
We will take effective measures to combat the terrorist threat.
There is now general acceptance that the future of Northern Ireland must be
determined by the consent of the people as set out in the Downing Street
Declaration. Labour recognises that the option of a united Ireland does not
command the consent of the Unionist tradition, nor does the existing status of
Northern Ireland command the consent of the Nationalist tradition. We are
therefore committed to reconciliation between the two traditions and to a new
political settlement which can command the support of both. Labour will help
build trust and confidence among both Nationalist and Unionist traditions in
Northern Ireland by acting to guarantee human rights, strengthen confidence in
policing, combat discrimination at work and reduce tensions over parades. Labour
will also foster economic progress and competitiveness in Northern Ireland, so
as to reduce unemployment.
We will give Britain leadership in Europe
  Referendum on single currency
  Lead reform of the EU
  Retain Trident: strong defence through NATO
  A reformed United Nations
  Helping to tackle global poverty
Britain, though an island nation with limited natural resources, has for
centuries been a leader of nations. But under the Conservatives Britain's
influence has waned.
With a new Labour government, Britain will be strong in defence; resolute in
standing up for its own interests; an advocate of human rights and democracy the
world over; a reliable and powerful ally in the international institutions of
which we are a member; and will be a leader in Europe.
Our vision of Europe is of an alliance of independent nations choosing to
co-operate to achieve the goals they cannot achieve alone. We oppose a European
federal superstate.
There are only three options for Britain in Europe. The first is to come out.
The second is to stay in, but on the sidelines. The third is to stay in, but in
a leading role.
An increasing number of Conservatives, overtly or covertly, favour the first.
But withdrawal would be disastrous for Britain. It would put millions of jobs at
risk. It would dry up inward investment. It would destroy our clout in
international trade negotiations. It would relegate Britain from the premier
division of nations.
The second is exactly where we are today under the Conservatives. The BSE fiasco
symbolises their failures in Europe.
The third is the path a new Labour government will take. A fresh start in
Europe, with the credibility to achieve reform. We have set out a detailed
agenda for reform, leading from the front during the UK presidency in the first
half of 1998:
  Rapid completion of the single market: a top priority for the British
  presidency. We will open up markets to competition; pursue tough action
  against unfair state aids; and ensure proper enforcement of single market
  rules. This will strengthen Europe's competitiveness and open up new
  opportunities for British firms.
  High priority for enlargement of the European Union to include the countries
  of central and eastern Europe and Cyprus, and the institutional reforms
  necessary to make an enlarged Europe work more efficiently.
  Urgent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. It is costly, vulnerable to
  fraud and not geared to environmental protection. Enlargement and the World
  Trade talks in 1999 will make reform even more essential. We will seek a
  thorough overhaul of the Common Fisheries Policy to conserve our fish stocks
  in the long-term interests of the UK fishing industry.
  Greater openness and democracy in EU institutions with open voting in the
  Council of Ministers and more effective scrutiny of the Commission by the
  European Parliament. We have long supported a proportional voting system for
  election to the European Parliament.
  Retention of the national veto over key matters of national interest, such as
  taxation, defence and security, immigration, decisions over the budget and
  treaty changes, while considering the extension of Qualified Majority Voting
  in limited areas where that is in Britain's interests.
  Britain to sign the Social Chapter. An 'empty chair' at the negotiating table
  is disastrous for Britain. The Social Chapter is a framework under which
  legislative measures can be agreed. Only two measures have been agreed -
  consultation for employees of large Europe-wide companies and entitlement to
  unpaid parental leave. Successful companies already work closely with their
  workforces. The Social Chapter cannot be used to force the harmonisation of
  social security or tax legislation and it does not cost jobs. We will use our
  participation to promote employability and flexibility, not high social costs.

The single currency
Any decision about Britain joining the single currency must be determined by a
hard-headed assessment of Britain's economic interests. Only Labour can be
trusted to do this: the Tories are riven by faction. But there are formidable
obstacles in the way of Britain being in the first wave of membership, if EMU
takes place on 1 January 1999. What is essential for the success of EMU is
genuine convergence among the economies that take part, without any fudging of
the rules. However, to exclude British membership of EMU forever would be to
destroy any influence we have over a process which will affect us whether we are
in or out. We must therefore play a full part in the debate to influence it in
Britain's interests.
In any event, there are three pre-conditions which would have to be satisfied
before Britain could join during the next Parliament: first, the Cabinet would
have to agree; then Parliament; and finally the people would have to say 'Yes'
in a referendum.
Strong defence through NATO
The post-Cold War world faces a range of new security challenges - proliferation
of weapons of mass destruction, the growth of ethnic nationalism and extremism,
international terrorism, and crime and drug trafficking. A new Labour government
will build a strong defence against these threats. Our security will continue to
be based on NATO.
Our armed forces are among the most effective in the world. The country takes
pride in their professionalism and courage. We will ensure that they remain
strong to defend Britain. But the security of Britain is best served in a secure
world, so we should be willing to contribute to wider international peace and
security both through the alliances to which we belong, in particular NATO and
the Western European Union, and through other international organisations such
as the UN and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
Labour will conduct a strategic defence and security review to reassess our
essential security interests and defence needs. It will consider how the roles,
missions and capabilities of our armed forces should be adjusted to meet the new
strategic realities. The review we propose will be foreign policy led, first
assessing our likely overseas commitments and interests and then establishing
how our forces should be deployed to meet them.
Arms control
A new Labour government will retain Trident. We will press for multilateral
negotiations towards mutual, balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear
weapons. When satisfied with verified progress towards our goal of the global
elimination of nuclear weapons, we will ensure that British nuclear weapons are
included in multilateral negotiations.
Labour will work for the effective implementation of the Chemical Weapons
Convention and for a strengthening of the Biological Weapons Convention. Labour
will ban the import, export, transfer and manufacture of all forms of
anti-personnel landmines. We will introduce an immediate moratorium on their
use. Labour will not permit the sale of arms to regimes that might use them for
internal repression or international aggression. We will increase the
transparency and accountability of decisions on export licences for arms. And we
will support an EU code of conduct governing arms sales.
We support a strong UK defence industry, which is a strategic part of our
industrial base as well as our defence effort. We believe that part of its
expertise can be extended to civilian use through a defence diversification
agency.
Leadership in the international community
A new Labour government will use Britain's permanent seat on the Security
Council to press for substantial reform of the United Nations, including an
early resolution of its funding crisis, and a more effective role in
peacekeeping, conflict prevention, the protection of human rights and
safeguarding the global environment.
The Commonwealth provides Britain with a unique network of contacts linked by
history, language and legal systems. Labour is committed to giving renewed
priority to the Commonwealth in our foreign relations. We will seize the
opportunity to increase trade and economic co-operation and will also build
alliances with our Commonwealth partners to promote reform at the UN and common
action on the global environment. Britain has a real opportunity to provide
leadership to the Commonwealth when we host the heads of government meeting in
Britain at the end of 1997.
Promoting economic and social development
Labour will also attach much higher priority to combating global poverty and
underdevelopment. According to the World Bank, there are 1. 3 billion people in
the world who live in absolute poverty, subsisting on less than US$1 a day,
while 35,000 children die each day from readily preventable diseases.
Labour believes that we have a clear moral responsibility to help combat global
poverty. In government we will strengthen and restructure the British aid
programme and bring development issues back into the mainstream of government
decision-making. A Cabinet minister will lead a new department of international
development.
We will shift aid resources towards programmes that help the poorest people in
the poorest countries. We reaffirm the UK's commitment to the 0.7 per cent UN
aid target and in government Labour will start to reverse the decline in UK aid
spending.
We will work for greater consistency between the aid, trade, agriculture and
economic reform policies of the EU. We will use our leadership position in the
EU to maintain and enhance the position of the poorest countries during the
renegotiation of the Lomo Convention.
We will support further measures to reduce the debt burden borne by the world's
poorest countries and to ensure that developing countries are given a fair deal
in international trade. It is our aim to rejoin UNESCO. We will consider how
this can be done most effectively and will ensure that the cost is met from
savings elsewhere.
Human rights
Labour wants Britain to be respected in the world for the integrity with which
it conducts its foreign relations. We will make the protection and promotion of
human rights a central part of our foreign policy. We will work for the creation
of a permanent international criminal court to investigate genocide, war crimes
and crimes against humanity.
A new environmental internationalism
Labour believes that the threats to the global climate should push environmental
concerns higher up the international agenda. A Labour government will strengthen
co-operation in the European Union on environmental issues, including climate
change and ozone depletion. We will lead the fight against global warming,
through our target of a 20 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the
year 2010.
Labour believes the international environment should be safeguarded in
negotiations over international trade. We will also work for the successful
negotiation of a new protocol on climate change to be completed in Japan in
1997.
Leadership, not isolation
There is a sharp division between those who believe the way to cope with global
change is for nations to retreat into isolationism and protectionism, and those
who believe in internationalism and engagement. Labour has traditionally been
the party of internationalism. Britain cannot be strong at home if it is weak
abroad. The tragedy of the Conservative years has been the squandering of
Britain's assets and the loss of Britain's influence.
A new Labour government will use those assets to the full to restore Britain's
pride and influence as a leading force for good in the world. With effective
leadership and clear vision, Britain could once again be at the centre of
international decision-making instead of at its margins.

UK_natl_1979_en_Lib.txt,"'The Real Fight is for Britain'

Introduction
With your support this election could be about something more important than a change of government. It could be a chance to change a failed political system.
Britain is deadlocked and that deadlock has meant economic and social decline. There can be very few voters, even among the keenest adherents of the Conservative or Labour cause, who really believe that our problems can all be solved just by yet another change of government. Oppositions promise grandiosely to generate 'the white hot heat of technological revolution' or to 'roll back the frontiers of the state'. It takes at least a year or two of government for them to come to terms with reality and discard their doctrinaire programmes. Each time the country is weakened further.
We have tried confrontation politics for long enough. In 1964, in 1970, in 1974, incoming governments promised that they held the key to Britain's industrial and social problems, if only they could undo the achievements of their predecessors and push their own prescriptions through Parliament. The hopes they raised have all been cruelly disappointed. It is high time to try a different pattern of government, which is based upon the consent and support of the broad majority of the electorate. That alone can now provide the basis for the long term programme of reform which Britain so desperately needs.
The Liberal Party has taken the first step towards breaking the deadlock during the past Parliament, by proving that co-operation among different parties is possible, practical and good for Britain. Unavoidably in this first experiment in a new style of government, our achievements were relatively limited. Many of the reforms which we wish to see implemented have had to wait.
But during the 18 months of the Liberal Agreement with the Labour Government the stability and consistency provided by co-operation among parties which represented a clear majority of the electorate, and the requirement that the Labour Government respect the views of that majority, helped to bring down the annual rate of inflation to 8 per cent. The Tories had raised it from 5.9 per cent to 13.2 per cent. Labour raised it further to a peak of 26.9 per cent, now it is rising again. The Lib-Lab Agreement also reduced Interest Rates to 10 per cent (Minimum Lending Rate). The Tories left it at 12.5 per cent under Labour it reached a peak of 15 per cent in October 1976. It is now back up again.
Industrial confidence began to return during the agreement. The divisive policies promoted by Labour's lunatic left-wing were effectively held in check. On Liberal insistence the law was changed to encourage profit-sharing, to help bridge the gulf of mistrust between the two sides of industry - which has so far led 48 companies to adopt new profit-sharing schemes.
Sadly, much of what was achieved for Britain during those 18 months has been thrown away since last October, as Labour clung on to office without secure and agreed majority support. If either of the two establishment parties grabs an exclusive hold on office after this election, Britain will slip even deeper into industrial confrontation and economic decay. The truth is, the Labour and Conservatives parties share a vested interest in the preservation of Britain's divided society. The unrepresentative nature of our electoral system protects them from the full effects of public disillusionment. Continuing industrial and social confrontation reinforces their links with the opposing sides of industry. Britain's secretive and centralised structure of government protects them, turn and turn about, from Parliament and the public.
Many, on both front benches, would rather see Britain's economy drift further behind our continental neighbours, would rather accept another cycle of industrial conflict and popular discontent, than touch the pattern of adversary politics which supports their alternating hold on political power.
I appeal to you, as a voter concerned with what is best for Britain, to throw your support behind the fresh approach which the Liberal Party represents - and which we have now demonstrated can work for Britain. The effectiveness of whatever government emerges after this election, the whole style of British government, will depend less upon which big/dinosaur Party returns with the largest number of parliamentary seats than upon the size of the Liberal wedge in the House of Commons. A mass Liberal vote throughout the country and many more Liberal seats will call the final whistle on a discredited Tory/Labour game.
Part Two of this manifesto sets out the Liberal Party's detailed electoral programme. I want here to stress four underlying themes: our commitment to fundamental political and constitutional reform; our proposals for economic and industrial reform; our plans to change and to simplify our overburdened tax system and our concern to bring to bear an environmental perspective across the whole range of government policies.
Political reform is the starting point. Until we break the two-party stranglehold, until we get away from the adversary class politics which are embedded in our parliamentary structure, we cannot successfully tackle the problems of economic weakness and industrial mistrust, of misspent resources in housing, of uncertain management of the public sector and of mishandled relations with our neighbours abroad. Electoral reform is the key to the lock. A democratic electoral system would deprive the Conservative and Labour parties of their ability to maintain electoral support by frightening wavering voters with the spectre of a single, unacceptable alternative. It would force them to face up to their own internal contradictions: the unstable coalition within a weakened Labour Party between its nationalising left and its conservative centre; the tensions within the Conservative Party between moderate Tories and doctrinaire free-marketeers. A democratic electoral system is needed, too, to generate the popular consent which is essential to support a long-term programme of economic and social reform.
The reluctant and unsatisfactory compromises which recent governments have offered in response to demands for the reform of Parliament, for an end to official secrecy, above all for devolution and decentralisation, also demonstrate the need for more thorough-going change and the inability of the establishment front benches to meet that need. Privately, many MPs from both the Labour and Conservative parties accept the case for far-reaching changes, but they are unwilling publicly to challenge their own leadership. A powerful wedge of Liberal MPs in the next Parliament could start a chain reaction of political change.
Economic and industrial reform must accompany and follow from political reform. Hardly surprisingly, the owner party and the union party have resisted the extension of democracy to industry, seeing a transformation of the pattern of industrial relations as a threat to their entrenched interests. Labour's preferred approach would only strengthen the position of trade unions, which are already one of the most conservative forces in our society. They do not want to involve the workforce as a whole. The Conservative alternative of lightly-disguised confrontation is even more dangerous in 1979 than their Selsdon Park proposals were in 1970, and would no doubt lead again after a painful two years in office to another expensive U-turn.
We Liberals seek instead to alter fundamentally the framework within which economic policy is made, to bring the different sides of industry together to work constructively to increase the well being of Britain - not to battle destructively over each other's share of a dwindling national cake.
The two-party confrontation has also wrought havoc with our tax system. Successive governments have tacked on new additions to an already unwieldy structure. It is too complex for most taxpayers to understand or to be sure of their rights and obligations. Many changes have been rushed through Parliament without adequate debate or consideration of their implications, at the behest of some vested interest or in the service of some outdated ideology. As a result tax avoidance has become our fastest growing industry. Liberals are concerned to simplify the personal tax system and reduce its burden to create a tax structure which encourages initiative and promotes a wider distribution of wealth, and above all to establish principles for a stable tax system which can command the respect of the electorate as a whole: wealthy, poor and average earners.
Neither of the two established parties has paid any serious attention to the long-term conservation of Britain's environment and resources. The argument over North Sea oil has been conducted in terms of immediate benefits rather than long term needs. The necessity to grow more of our own food and the conservation of man's natural habitat, including its flora and fauna, have been wrongly regarded as low priorities in politics. The debate over Britain's future dependence on nuclear power has hardly touched Parliament, conducted instead by environmental groups through the limited forum of the Windscale inquiry. Yet conservation and recycling of our limited and often finite resources is a vital issue for Britain's future, and an issue which concerns a growing section of our electorate. We Liberals have used our influence to force Parliament to pay more attention to the ecological perspective.
But Parliament as at present constructed does not find it easy to focus on questions like this, which do not fall conveniently into the categories established by the conventions of two-Party politics or the Left/Right dog-fight. Here is a key issue for Britain as the new Parliament takes us into the 1980s, too complicated for the current ritual of debate but too important to ignore.
It may seem paradoxical that Liberals call at once for more stable government and for radical change. Our concern is for long-term change, as opposed to the twists and turns of short-term policies which have characterised British government since the end of the Second World War. Worthwhile reforms for Britain's economy, for its industrial relations, its tax structure, its social services, its political system itself, can only be achieved after thorough examination and open debate - and can only be made to last if they command the respect and acceptance of the majority of the electorate.
That is why we are prepared to co-operate with other parties, even as we insist on the need for a fundamental break in Britain's political habits. Of course we want in time to see Britain led by a Liberal Government, implementing a coherent radical programme with the support of a clear majority of voters. But meanwhile we are prepared to co-operate with whichever party will go with us some way along the same road. It would, after all, be a profound and radical change for Britain to benefit from stability in economic policy, to gain a new consensus in pay policy and industrial relations, to achieve a wider agreement on the structure of taxation, or to open up a searching debate on the best use of Britain's limited resources.
It would be a radical change in itself for the next government to have to base its policies upon the support of the representatives of a genuine majority of the electorate. With your support, and the support of millions of voters like you, we can ensure that those changes take place.
David Steel

Economic and industrial recovery can only follow from a radical programme of political and social reform. In a liberal society in Britain, power and wealth will be distributed more widely, and government subjected to open democratic control. Participation and self-management will be encouraged, in government and in industry; public and private power will be, where possible, dispersed: individual initiative and independence will be rewarded; and a sense of partnership and community strengthened. But UK action alone cannot provide the stimulus for these major political and social changes. Many of our problems have to be tackled at the European level; action is also needed in the regions and nations of the United Kingdom, and within local communities through the efforts of voluntary bodies and community groups. But in an over-centralised Britain the process of reform is most urgently needed at the centre, in Westminster and Whitehall.
POLITICAL REFORM
Britain has a grossly undemocratic voting system, over-centralised government and an ineffective Parliament. Piecemeal changes have failed to introduce the necessary constitutional reforms. Bureaucracy and powerful organisations triumph at the expense of individuals who feel powerless to influence decisions that affect them. Liberals believe:
1 That electoral reform is the essential first step to representative parliament and government.
2 In open government accountable to a reformed parliament.
3 That decisions must be taken at the most local level practicable.
4 People and their communities must take part in decisions that affect them.
Reform of the Voting System
Our first priority is electoral reform, because Britain's voting system is a root cause of our troubles:
It damages living standards by preventing consistent economic and social policies.
It leads to governments claiming a false mandate in favour of policies which have been decisively rejected by a majority of the voters.
It encourages native voting, frustrates the intelligent elector and leads to increasing alienation from the whole political system.
It rewards parties based on class distinctions and reinforces class divisions. Without reform our whole democracy is at risk.
Liberals demand proportional representation at all levels of government:
At Westminster, to give us representative parliaments and genuine majority government.
For future elections to the European Parliament, to avoid the disgrace of being the only member of the EEC not to use a fair voting system.
In local government, where the present system can often produce one-party dominance with its dangers of corruption.
The system adopted must ensure that every vote is of equal value and affects the result. It must also ensure that parties win roughly the same proportion of seats as their proportion of votes, allow voters a choice between candidates in each party, and reflect minority interest and viewpoints. Liberals believe that of available PR systems, the single transferable vote (STV) best achieves these results.
The main opposition to the overwhelming popular demand for electoral reform comes from political machines exercising unjustified privilege, and from those MP's who fear that if voters had a real choice they would not be re-elected. Liberals support the people in their fight against electoral privilege, and will give first priority in the new Parliament to obtaining a cast-iron commitment to the early introduction of electoral reform.
Reform of Parliament and Government
Parliament should take control of its own business out of the hands of Government, and set up powerful Select Committees, to assert vigorous democratic control over the Executive. Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act should be repealed. We would introduce a Freedom of Information Bill similar to that of the Liberal MP Clement Freud in the last Parliament. This would give a right of public access to all official information except for certain listed categories (e.g. defence, economic and commercially sensitive information, and individual records).
A National Efficiency Audit should be set up to scrutinise public expenditure plans and reduce waste.
We need fixed dates for parliamentary elections to avoid the uncertainty which Prime Ministerial privilege imposes on the country.
The House of Lords should be replaced by a new, democratically chosen, second chamber which includes representatives of the nations and regions of the United Kingdom, and UK members of the European Parliament.
Reform of the Constitution - a Federal Solution
Liberals supported the Scotland and Wales Acts, for all their defects, because we believed they offered a step in the right direction. These deficiencies - the weakness of the proposed Welsh Assembly and the constitutional contradictions in the Scotland Act - were exposed in the referendum debates and contributed to the results. This experience has reinforced our belief that the massive decentralisation of power from Westminster and Whitehall to Scotland, Wales and the major regions of England - for which we have long called - must involve legislative, executive and fiscal powers taken together. It has also demonstrated the need for a federal approach, which will involve a written constitution and a Supreme Court, as the only approach which can achieve legislative devolution within a workable framework of government for the United Kingdom.
Whatever the outcome of the election, Liberals will press for the widest possible consultations among the parties on constitutional reform.
Local Government
The Tory reorganisation of local government proved an expensive disaster. In due course, the district and county councils must be replaced by one tier of multi-purpose authorities, whose boundaries match local needs and circumstances.
We support the establishment of parish councils in urban areas and the extension of the powers of existing parish councils. These councils should have a statutory right 'to be consulted' by local government and other bodies and a duty to stimulate local democracy.
NORTHERN IRELAND
Progress towards peace ought to come from within the Province but if outside help is required Great Britain must be prepared to contribute.
As an interim measure we propose that a 15 to 20 member Advisory Council be elected by the people of Northern Ireland using PR(STV). Such a council would be large enough to let every significant viewpoint have a voice but small enough for all its members to have real discussion with each other as well as with the Secretary of State and other political representatives.
The Council would:
1 Represent the views of the people of Northern Ireland to the Secretary of State and advise him accordingly, and
2 discuss how a constitutional conference should be set up to consider the means by which a generally acceptable form of government for the Province should be developed.
There must be no capitulation to violence. Direct rule must continue for the time being. The civil power must be given military assistance for as long as required. Britain will not force Northern Ireland to unite with the Republic of Ireland. All elections, including those for Westminster, must be by PR(STV). Continuing emphasis must be placed on the achievement of full human rights.
REFORMS TO STRENGTHEN CITIZENS' RIGHTS
The liberty of the individual requires constant vigilance. Restrictions can only be
justified if they protect the freedom of others. Liberals emphasise:
1 Legislation to protect individual rights.
2 A clear definition of citizenship.
3 Equal opportunities for men and women in all spheres, especially equal pay for work of equal value.
4 Protection for minority groups.
Individual Freedom
We need a Bill of Rights - as a first step, Britain should incorporate the European
Convention of Human Rights into United Kingdom law. Individual rights protected by
law should include:
The right to see, correct and add comments to one's personal records held by public and private bodies.
The right of individual privacy.
The right of free association with others, including the right to be represented through a Trade Union.
The right to work without having to be a member of a Trade Union and the right to cross a picket line without intimidation.
The rights of those in police custody, by means of revised Judges' Rules.
Reduction of Crime
The steady increase in crime can only be checked in the short run by:
Recruiting many more police, by improving working conditions.
Strengthening the links between the police and the communities that they serve. Raving the greatest practicable number of policemen 'on the beat' by day and night.
Making more resources and facilities (including secure accommodation) available to magistrates and others concerned with juvenile offenders, to curb juvenile crime and rehabilitate juvenile offenders.
Prisons must be modernised and further experiments made with non-custodial treatment, except for those whose imprisonment is necessary for the protection of society.
At the same time, we must realise that the long term solution is to attack vigorously the social, environmental and economic seedbeds of crime such as broken homes, bad schools, drink and drugs, decaying cities, bad housing, unemployment, and the boredom of mass production society.
Nationality and Entry to the UK
There should be only one class of citizenship for citizens of the UK and colonies. We would abolish the discrimination against non-patrials which creates second-class citizens. Citizens of the UK and colonies, including residents of Commonwealth countries who accepted the offer of remaining UK citizens when independence was granted, should have a right of entry. Spouses, children and other dependents of UK residents should be allowed to join their families in Britain and all children who have been born abroad of British mothers must have automatic right of citizenship.
Liberals deplore the Tory policy of inflaming people's fears about unrestricted immigration when the numbers of immigrants are actually falling. We should, wherever practicable, accept bona fide refugees.
Equal Opportunities for Women and Men
In order to ensure equal opportunities and rewards for women and men, we propose:
Changes in the patterns of work to allow for greater flexibility, part-time and weekend work, so that men and women can better meet their social and family needs.
Legislation to ensure that job evaluation schemes give adequate weight to factors found predominantly in work customarily done by women.
Removal of anomalies in National Insurance benefits which are based on outdated assumptions about the roles of men and women in contributing to family income. Reshaping the Equal Opportunities Commission to create an effective instrument against discrimination.
Minority Rights
Britain is a diverse and multicultural society and Liberals rejoice in its richness, which owes much to the peoples of many different ethnic origins and cultures who have chosen to live here. We defend their right to maintain and develop their own traditions. Minority groups must be allowed to practise and advocate their beliefs, provided this does not reduce the freedom of others. We will protect and defend the rights of minorities by:
A comprehensive law out-lawing discrimination on grounds of race, sex or political belief with enforcement through a single Anti-Discrimination Board.
Providing a legal right for nomadic people to live according to their life-style so long as this does not harm others.
Removing all legal discrimination based on sexual orientation.
ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL REFORM
The failures of our political system are reflected in our economic and industrial system. Confrontation is used instead of co-operation, resistance to change obstructs innovation, and frequent changes of government policy weaken our economy still further. Inflation has started to rise again, unemployment is unacceptably high and we are becoming increasingly uncompetitive in world markets. We have an unjust industrial society in which most workers are pitted against management and are denied any share in decision-taking or in profits.
We need a radical long-term programme of reforms to restore Britain's economy and industrial prosperity.
Liberals believe in:
1 Controlled and steady economic growth (in co-operation with our European partners), with greater attention to conservation of scarce resources, especially energy and land.
2 Harnessing the potential of all at work to improve enterprise and productivity.
3 Providing opportunities of useful work for all.
4 Protecting the citizen from inflation by reconciling rises in incomes with the real rate of growth of the economy.
5 Ensuring that the primary aim of government intervention in industry should be the promotion of viable market enterprises.
We see a revolution in attitudes amongst all at work through the introduction of Democracy in Industry as the key to reversing Britain's economic decline. This means employees sharing control and profits with shareholders. We would achieve this by giving all employees (irrespective of trade union membership) legal rights as individual members of their company; a direct vote in electing the board of directors jointly with the shareholders; rights to information about its plans and prospects; to participate in decisions through elected works councils; and to share in the profits. Liberals would encourage producer co-operatives by establishing a Cooperative Development Bank.
Efficient use of resources means reducing Britain's consumption of non-renewable raw materials, through government support (including tax incentives and penalties) for conservation, energy saving and recycling schemes. Whilst public expenditure already takes too large a share of our present national income, our health services, the schools and other essential public services cry out for more resources and the armed services remain underpaid. Economic recovery is essential to provide in the long run extra funds needed to continue the fight against poverty and deprivation. But in the immediate future, they can be found only by a relentless war against bureaucratic waste in central and local government.
More jobs in new industries, as well as in agriculture and in the service sector, must be created to replace those being lost through international competition and technological change. Further positive discrimination in favour of small businesses and producer co-operatives, through changes in the tax system and in planning controls, will help to provide the catalyst for industrial renewal. This will build upon the success of the Liberals in getting the Government to appoint a senior Cabinet minister for the small business field, which has already led to major tax concessions and other reliefs.
Employers, unions and public authorities must not be allowed to obstruct retraining. Liberals also challenge the belief in bigness for its own sake and concentration of control at the centre in both the private and public sectors. We aim at decentralisation, with greater autonomy for individual working units to encourage initiative and participation.
We would introduce a sustained prices and incomes policy based on wide consultation and enforceable at law. Our incomes policy would be supported by tax measures and a national minimum income. It would reward increases in value-added. We support attempts to synchronise annual wage settlements.
Liberal proposals for reducing personal taxation, introducing industrial democracy and profit-sharing are essential elements of an incomes policy since they would transform the industrial climate, restore incentive and reduce inflationary expectations.
The role of government is to provide a stable political and economic framework, not to dominate the economy. But it is dangerous to pretend that government can be taken out of economic and industrial planning, given the unavoidable importance of public spending and the active involvement of governments of competitor countries in supporting their industries and promoting their own economic interests. There is no case for further large-scale nationalisation in Britain; but attempts to denationalise at present would further disrupt the industries affected. The National Enterprise Board provides a valuable mechanism for assisting new industries and for aiding companies temporarily in difficulty, but it should disengage from them when they regain commercial viability.
The framework of government economic and industrial policy should be made more open and more subject to parliamentary control, by including Opposition parties on the National Economic Development Council and by establishing a Select Committee for Economic Affairs to consider its reports. Economic recovery is too vital to be subjected to all the twists and turns of partisan tactics, with Opposition parties glorying in their ignorance of facts which face government, and promising to reverse central decisions. Consistent economic policy requires a transformation of the way in which policies are debated and decided.
REFORM OF THE TAX SYSTEM
The British tax system frustrates initiative, inhibits new enterprises and discourages the wider spread of wealth. Penal rates of taxation encourage successful avoidance and evasion; whilst the poor and disadvantaged face a bewildering array of means tests and often fail to receive an adequate income.
Liberals believe in:
1 Providing an adequate minimum income for all.
2 Treating men and woman as equals for tax purposes, whether married or single.
3 Providing greater incentives for earning, productivity and enterprise.
4 Encouraging employees to build up a stake in their enterprise.
5 Widening the distribution and individual ownership of wealth.
The central reform needed is the introduction of Credit Income Tax which should:
Abolish the means test.
Introduce cash credits in place of personal allowances, social security payments and
national insurance benefits.
Provide credits for students of all ages, for rate relief and housing.
We also need a major switch from taxes on income to taxes on wealth and expenditure and propose:
Income Tax starting at 20 per cent with a top rate of 50 per cent.
A substantial increase in the level of income at which people first pay income tax.
A gifts and legacies tax paid by the recipient in place of Capital Transfer Tax.
A wealth tax on very large capital accumulations in place of the Investment Income
Surcharge which would be repealed.
Tax incentives for profit-sharing and employee share ownership.
Self assessment of tax liability with spot-checks by the Inland Revenue.
The changeover would be introduced over several years and be matched by indexation of taxes on drinks and tobacco, a single rate of VAT and the replacement of the employer's National Insurance contribution with a regionally varied payroll tax.
In a Federal Britain, regional and local government would have powers to raise the revenue they need for the services they provide. Income tax would be the main source of revenue at regional level with a tax on all land values (except agricultural land which would be zero-rated) being the main source of revenue for local government, which would also have powers to levy its own taxes. These would replace domestic rates.
A CARING SOCIETY
Liberals laid the foundations of the modern welfare state, but the original vision has been lost in a jungle of complex rules, means tests and decisions taken by remote officials. Those most in need often fail to get help or are caught by the poverty trap, whilst others fall through the gaps.
Liberals believe in:
1 Recreating services which recognise and respond to human needs, without excessive bureaucracy.
2 Making a reality of democratic control.
3 Providing greater choice for the individual.
4 Renewing inner city life.
The Change to Credit Income Tax
Tax credits would meet the needs of the unemployed, retired, disabled and disadvantaged, and provide for maternity, children and students of all ages. All income would be taxable and where tax liability exceeds cash credits, the difference would be paid as tax; where credits exceed tax, individuals would receive cash regularly.
It would take several years to introduce a full tax credit scheme and in the meantime, we would give priority to:
Further increases in child benefit and the progressive conversion of other allowances against income tax into positive cash credits.
The introduction of a supplementary pension for all pensioners not qualifying for a full earnings-related pension under the new state pension scheme, reducing the number of pensioners needing to apply for supplementary benefit.
The introduction of a disablement allowance to help offset the additional expenditure caused by disablement.
The early introduction of housing credits based on average local rents. An increase in the mobility allowance and its extension to those over retirement age.
The implementation of the Finer' recommendations for one-parent families. The removal of the anomalies affecting widows and others through the application of the rule about overlapping benefits.
Care in the Community
Liberals seek to make the welfare state more effective and democratic. Providers and receivers of care should participate in running the services. The elderly (especially the over 75s), single-parent families, the disabled, the mentally handicapped and the mentally ill should have priority for additional resources.
We propose to tackle the mushrooming bureaucracy created by the Tories reorganisation of the health service by abolishing the area health authorities and bringing power back to the level of the local health district, and by placing the regional health authorities under the control of elected Scottish, Welsh and Regional assemblies.
We would give a greater role for voluntary organisations in partnership with official services. We oppose widespread closure of cottage hospitals and encourage the retention of local pharmacies.
Housing
Housing policy should retain existing communities and help build new ones. Priority must be given to improvement of existing houses instead of wholesale clearance and rebuilding. Everyone must have access to adequate housing with a wide choice of tenure and type of home - within the price they can afford. Private and council tenants should have reasonable security of tenure, and help control the management of housing and its immediate environment. We would introduce an Occupiers' and Owners' Charter which safeguards the rights of both tenants and owners of rented housing.
Housing co-operatives and smaller locally-based housing associations, which should be run democratically, should be encouraged. Councils should be required to build more homes for sale, and adequate resources should be provided for the full implementation of the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act, a measure introduced by Liberals.
Liberals would concentrate resources on inner cities by positive planning for community based jobs, schools, housing and entertainment.
Education and Training
We see education and training as a lifelong process that must be as widely available as possible to people of all ages. Secondary education must be non-selective with schools and colleges matched to local needs and working together to give maximum choice to students. Post-school education must be integrated with closer links between universities, polytechnics and further education.
We want to see:
Nursery education for all children whose parents want it.
The immediate right of rising-fives to enter primary school.
Use of successfully qualified teachers now unemployed to reduce class sizes and improve literacy and numeracy.
The involvement of all staff, parents and pupils in the running of schools through elected governing boards, and elected schools councils for secondary schools.
Improved links between schools and industry to ensure preparation for the world. Expansion of adult education and a major expansion of training and retraining facilities in which Britain still lags far behind its industrial competitors.
Education for retirement from employment.
CONSERVATION OF RESOURCES AND ENVIRONMENT
The industrial world consumes far too much of the world's non-renewable resources and is becoming increasingly dependent on imports of energy. Many of man's activities threaten the natural environment. Few recognise that after the year 2,000, shortages of food, raw materials and energy will mean drastic changes to our lifestyles. The bonanza of North Sea oil must not blind us to the dangers facing us when the oil runs out We must start to change our attitudes now. Liberals believe in:
1 Conservation and wiser use of scarce resources, especially land and energy.
2 War on waste and pollution.
3 The need to preserve the natural environment for future generations.
4 A re-ordering of our economic and social priorities to put them on a sound basis.
Energy and North Sea oil
Liberals have repeatedly expressed doubts about a massive commitment to nuclear power and questioned the decision to expand the Windscale reprocessing plant. We must spread the extraction of North Sea oil over a longer period and use the revenues for long term investment with high priority for widespread energy conservation and developing alternative energy sources. We must:
Substantially increase research and development on fusion, wave, solar and other sustainable sources of energy.
Make greater use of combined heat and power systems which use waste heat.
Promote maximum efficiency in the production and use of coal and the use of primary fuels.
Set up a permanent Energy Commission to discuss in public future energy options. Not build any more nuclear power stations, at least until the problems of safe and permanent disposal of radioactive waste have been solved.
Transport
We would legislate to improve the standards of public transport in both towns and rural areas by making it more responsive to local needs and subject to democratic control. We would:
Encourage self-help and other schemes which improve freight and personal mobility in rural areas.
Amend the licensing laws governing stage carriage services to encourage local operators.
Plan jobs and homes closer together, discourage the private motor-car in city centres and provide better facilities for pedestrians and cyclists.
Limit expenditure on new road-building to socially desirable projects. Increase emphasis on road safety and therefore support the early introduction of tachographs in lorries.
Oppose further nationalisation of the ports and reject implementation of the Dock Work Regulations Scheme.
Retain the British Waters Board and increase expenditure on canal maintenance. Retain the British Rail network - and, where necessary, treat it as a social service. Support a rail-only Channel Tunnel financed with the aid of EEC finances. Improve the international communications of the regions by dispersing more international air traffic outside London.
Food and Agriculture
Liberal policy aims at providing a fair return for the farmer and reasonably priced food for the consumer. We also need a co-ordinated approach to the needs of food production and conservation of natural wild life which recognises their interdependence. We therefore propose:
Fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy to produce competitive prices, avoid structural food surpluses and encourage efficient farming; the creation of a Land Bank to help new entrants to farming, and the expansion of co-operatives.
More land for small-holdings.
To raise the guaranteed minimum earnings for farmworkers.
Radical reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, conservation of fish stocks and a fifty mile exclusive limit for each member state within the EEC.
Increase the number of abattoirs to EEC standards to discourage the export of live animals.
Safeguarding the Environment
Land is a finite resource and we need careful planning to ensure an adequate supply of land for housing without using valuable farm land. Resources should be concentrated on inner city renewal and rural regeneration so that all parts of Britain are fit to live in. We have a duty to preserve in trust for future generations that which we inherit from the past. We would:
Make polluters pay the cost of their pollution. Drastically amend the Community Land Act.
Introduce taxation of the unimproved value of land, in its optimum permitted use (agricultural land to be zero-rated).
Introduced fiscal incentives for conservation, reclamation of industrial wasteland and recycling.
Encourage rurally based crafts and appropriate industries in rural areas. Support the demand of the General Election Co-ordinating Committee for Animal Protection for a Royal Commission on Animal Welfare.
Ban the importation and manufacture of any product derived from any species whose survival is threatened, and work for a total ban on commercial whaling. Expedite the work of the Commons Commissioners and legislate to implement the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Common Land with regard to access and management.
Preserve moors, scrub woodland, wetlands and other wildlife 'reservoirs'.
EUROPE AND THE WORLD
Liberals believe in:
1 Opposing all forms of aggression and imperialism.
2 Emphasising the protection of political and human rights as a basis for foreign policy.
3 Fostering closer co-operation within the European Community as the most constructive means of promoting Britain's best interests.
4 Supporting closer integration of defence, security and weapons procurement policies within the Atlantic Alliance as the most effective way of utilizing scarce resources.
5 Working for a more equitable distribution of power and wealth throughout the world. Liberals support positive co-operation with the developing countries.
Economic weakness and political failure have reduced Britain's standing and influence in the world and strained the friendship of our partners in Western Europe and beyond.
In Europe, we support a stronger and more democratic Community. Our long-term aim is a federal Europe based upon democratic institutions and an equitable sharing of economic and social burdens. This involves working towards economic and monetary union and more effective regional and social policies to overcome unemployment and deprivation. It also means commitment to the strengthening of the European Parliament. Only such a Parliament, elected by Proportional Representation, can provide democratic political solutions to Europe's problems and make nationalist solutions as irrelevant as they are dangerous.
Both Labour and Conservative Governments have been short-sighted and inward-looking in their attitudes to Europe. The Labour Government's nationalistic stance has harmed Britain's interests by blocking avenues for wider agreement. Britain's foreign policy should become increasingly concerted with our European partners, and our aim must therefore be the evolution of common European policies, not to pursue the nostalgic illusion of independent power.
Europe's foreign policies must include continued close relations with the United States. We firmly support a peaceful settlement of the Middle East conflict within the framework of the relevant United Nations Resolutions. In Southern Africa, Britain has a special historic responsibility, and we must continue to work with our allies and with the United Nations to promote peaceful change. We support the Anglo-American efforts being made to end bloodshed and to establish an independent Zimbabwe with a Government elected under international supervision. We believe that sanctions should not be lifted nor recognition accorded until such a government is established.
Europe's defence must be a common defence, based on integrated forces and an integrated command within the Atlantic Alliance. Co-operation in armaments should be accompanied by ending British arms sales except in the context of a treaty of mutual defence. The fundamental solution to the problem depends on the establishment of a credible system of international controls of arms sales under the aegis of the United Nations. Arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union and its allies should be vigorously pursued to promote a basis for the mutual and balanced reduction of forces and armaments.
It is one of the most important duties of Europe to help those peoples of the Third World who still lack effective influence in the international economy. In this context, Britain, because of our links with the Commonwealth, has a distinctive contribution to make. Liberals want to see reductions in the barriers to world trade, and support current negotiations to give the developing countries stable prices for their raw materials UK official aid should be increased to achieve the targets agreed by the United Nations.
The work of the UN specialised agencies and of voluntary organisations should be generously supported. Aid should be directed wherever possible through multi-lateral channels, but there is no justice in assisting governments which systematically deny basic human rights to their own citizens.
CONCLUSION
The Liberal programme offers a coherent framework for a series of reforms which will need years of intensive effort. This requires for its success the support of an informed public, co-operation in industry, and a new spirit of mutual understanding among the democratic political parties. The vital choice at this election is whether Britain will start along this new path, or continue to shuffle down the slope of economic and political decline. The contents of the first Queen's Speech are less important than the membership, composition and spirit of the new Parliament. A stronger Liberal presence, backed by a powerful Liberal vote throughout the country, will ensure that the door is opened to fundamental change, not slammed shut again by the negative reactions of the old two-party game which has failed the nation.
